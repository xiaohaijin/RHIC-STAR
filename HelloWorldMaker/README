HelloWorld.C Notes:

Make sure to "cons" in this directory before you try to run
the macro.  This is because it depends on software in the
StRoot subdirectory.

Execute the HelloWorld.C() macro using root4star.  

For example:

root4star [0] .x HelloWorld.C() 

The output goes to the screen.  It is merely a bunch
of lines with *** hello world *** interspersed.

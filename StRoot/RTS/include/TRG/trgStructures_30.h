 *  06Dec99 zm  Created so offline can use and after modification for mod 8 DMA reads 
 *  08Dec99 zm  Changed Event Descriptor Structure to previous length                 
 *  03Feb00 zm  Changed "ushort ZDCDSM[8]" to "BYTE ZDC[16]" in L0_DSM_Data structure 
 *  22Jul00 egj Added L0RegBytes and L0RegHeader to trgDataHeaders and TrgSumData.    
 *              Also added Mult_Reg, ZDC_Reg and Spare_Reg to TrgSumData, making a    
 *              total of 16 extra bytes. I compensated for this by removing 16 bytes, 
 *              (4 uints) from L2Result, wich is currently unused.                    
 *  08Dec00 JMN Changed char hdr[2] in  TrgSummary to unsigned short, which is packed 
 *  25Feb01 JMN Redesigned and expanded abbreviations to full.                        
 *  12Mar01 JMN Added additional changes from ZM                                      
 *  30May01 JMN NBNBNBNB Changed FORMAT version from 0x12 to 0x13                     
 *  02Jun01 zm  defined bit 6 in addBits info FIFO3 for L2.5 abort                    
 *  27Jun01 JMN Added definition of number of bytes used in trigger summary headers   
 *  28Jun01 JMN Added definition of ADD_BITs                                          
 *  10Apr02 zm  basic strawman for new structures with new TCU and added detectors
 *  22May02 zm  removed references to current non-existent trigger event header
 *  24May02 zm  incorporated eleanor's comments
 *  24May02 zm  the L0_DSM_Data instance changed from DSM to DSMdata to be able to compile on linux
 *  19Jun02 zm  removed or commented out references to TrgEvtHeader
 *  05Aug02 JMN changes in event descriptor - moved filler word to end
 *  15Aug02 HjC correct bytes for FPD
 *  21Nov02 zm  corrections based on eleanor's email: L0 layout for bunch xing, 
 *              special and fpd elements; fpd broken down for east/west nort/south 
 *              vs top/bottom and layer 1 or 0;
 *              also finished XXX_DATA_OFFSET and RAW_XXX_LEN for passing data from
 *              dsm
 *  30Aug03 JMN Added RAW_MAX_LEN being maximum length possible in chain block transfer
 *  14Sep03 JMN Added new dsmMemcpy2Buf
 *  02Nov03 JMN Modified dsmMemcpy2Buf to ensure dsmData is 8-byte aligned.
 *  04Nov03 EGJ Modified RawTrgDet to add in ZDCSMD[32]
 *  28Oct04 JMN Modified RawTrgDet to increased BBC storage from 80 to 96
 *              Format version changed from 0x21 to 0x22
 *  14Nov05 JMN Added source NodeID as first word of data buffer to L2
 *  16Mar06 CWP Added offsets into L2Result
 *  20Dec06 JMN Added changes:  L2Result increased to 64 ints,
 *                              MWC name changed to MIX with 7 DSMs from MTD, VPD and TOF (112 bytes)
 *                              FPE changed to 9 DSMs (144 bytes)
 *                              FPW changed to 16 DSMs (256) bytes
 *                              new array QQT installed after BBC
 *              Block of commented OFFSETs and LEN removed.
 *              Commented out xx_SUM_LEN where xx is L0, L1, L2; and L0_REG_LEN.  Unused?
 *              Since these are significant changes, Format changed to 3.0
 *  05Jan07 JMN Changed CPA[32] to MTD[8],VPD[8],CPA[16]
 *  29Mar07 JMN Updated L2_Results offsets for CP
 *  03Apr07 JMN Order MTD,VPD,CPA is changed to CPA,MTD,VPD to reflect order of DSMs in the L1 crate

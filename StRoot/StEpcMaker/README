                           (StEpcMaker)
                    --------------------------
Author:: Subhasis Chattopadhyay(WSU)
Proposed on :: 05/04/00
-------------------------------------





    This Maker does the job of bringing together the info obtained from 
 all the subdetectors (e.g BEMC, BPRS, BSMD_eta, BSMD_phi) for matching
 and then generate objects which contains info about the incident shower.
  
  Currently Preshower (PRS) info is not included.


    StEpcMaker takes the following data as inputs

    (a) StEmcHitCollection (generated by "emc")

    (b) StEmcPreClusterCollection ( generated by "preecl")
         and StEmcPreCluster

    (c) St_dst_trk (generated by "match")


   This maker therefore should run after "emc", "preecl" and "match".

 Funtionality:
--------------

    FindCandidates:
    ===============

        This method collects all the clusters and the sort them according to 
    module number and phibin of each Emc subdetectors.

    
    GlobSort
    ========

       Takes global track as input, obtains the point of intersection on EMC 
    cylinder and calculates (eta,phi) of the intersection point.

     GetEmcPoint
     ===========

      Matching is performed according to each [module no][phibin]. 

       It can encounter 4 different categories,

       (a) Clusters obtained for only BEMC and not in SMDs

       (b) No Cluster in SMD_eta, clusters found in BEMC, SMD_phi

       (c) No Cluster in SMD_phi, clusters found in BEMC, SMD_eta

       (d) Clusters found in BEMC, SMD_eta , SMD_phi

      Depending on the scenario, different algorithms are used to perform 
    following tasks,

        (i) clusters found are matched with track depending on its
      proximity according to (eta_cluster-eta_tr) and (phi_cluster_phi_tr).

        (ii) In case of more than 1 possibilities of pair in SMD clusters,
           assignment is made according to the closeness of energy observed 
       in SMD_eta and SMD_phi clusters using cernlib assndx.

        (iii) BEMC cluster energy is split into matched clusters according to
        energy deposition in SMD clusters.


     StPi0candidate
     -----------------

      This is a temporary class to store the shower data obtained from 
   Emc matching. As soon as we know how to include StEmcPoint in StEvent, 
   StPi0candidate will be relaced by StEmcPoint.

    Currently StPi0Candidate contains (eta,phi, sigmaeta,sigmaphi, energy,
   matched track momenta, deltaeta, deltaphi,category of match). These can
   be used to generate invariant mass spectra even at this stage.

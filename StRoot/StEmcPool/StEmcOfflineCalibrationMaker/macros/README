README for BTOW gain calibration code contained in StRoot/StEmcPool/StEmcOfflineCalibration/
last updated 17 January 2014

You need the following files to perform the gain calibrations (as of the 2009 and 2011 calibrations): 
StEmcOfflineCalibrationEvent.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationEvent.h
StEmcOfflineCalibrationMaker.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationMaker.h
StEmcOfflineCalibrationElectronAnalyzer.cxx
StEmcOfflineCalibrationElectronAnalyzer.h
macros/bemcCalibMacro.C
macros/btow_mapping.20030401.0.txt
macros/CalibrationHelperFunctions.cxx
macros/CalibrationHelperFunctions.h
macros/electron_drawfits.C
macros/electron_histogram_maker.C
macros/electron_master.C
macros/electron_master_alt.C
macros/electron_tree_maker.C
macros/geant_fits.root
macros/mip_histogram_fitter.C
macros/mip_histogram_maker.C
macros/SubmitCalibJobs.pl
macros/runMIPjobs.sh
macros/runElecJobs.sh
macros/runFinalElecJobs.sh

The following files are outdated and can be removed from your working directory: 
macros/all2006runs.xml
macros/electron_ntuple_maker.C
macros/geant_func.root
macros/log4j.xml
macros/mip_ring_draw.C
macros/mip_ring_fitter.C

The codes should be run in this order:
1) SubmitCalibJobs.pl which executes bemcCalibMacro.C
2) runMIPjobs.sh which executes mip_histogram_maker.C
3) mip_histogram_fitter.C
4) runElecJobs.sh which executes electron_tree_maker.C
5) runFinalElecJobs.sh which executs electron_master_alt.C
6) electron_drawfits.C
-- OR --
5) electron_master.C

          INTRODUCTION TO OFFLINE TRIGGER SOFTWARE ACTIVITIES
                    HERBERT WARD, May 28 2001

===================================================================
SECTION 1, PRELIMINARY STEPS

Get an account on a machine set up for the STAR offline environment.  I
always use rmine602.rhic.bnl.gov (Solaris).

Decide which run you want to analyze.  This may involve finding
min-bias runs with the database SQL interface, with the WWW run 
browser, or by visiting Jeff Porter.  Notes on using the database 
SQL database are included in this StTrgMaker/doc directory in the
file database_notes.txt.

Write/visit Lidia Didenko (didenko@bnl.gov) with this message:
      Hello Lidia.  Where are the .event.root files
      for run XXXXXXX?  Also, what is the
      proper value of $STAR for reading
      these files?

Check that the files Lidia specifies exist.

If she says $STAR = dev, type "stardev".
If she says $STAR = new, type "starnew".
If she says $STAR = pro, type "starpro".
If she says $STAR = old, type "starold".
Do this in all your windows and every time you log in.

When working in the STAR offline enviroment, the word "maker" is jargon
for a software module in the analysis loop which runs one time per event.

STAR offline work in the root4star environment demands C++ expertise.  
But you need only a little of the ++ stuff.  If you can write C you're
OK.  You don't need to know what a "const virtual overloaded class
method" is.

Now decide whether you want to use the track-extension software that I
wrote for calibrating the CTB.  If yes, go to Section 2.  If no, go to
Section 3.

===========================================================
SECTION 2, USE THE TRACK EXTENSION SOFTWARE THAT HERB WROTE.

This will be much easier on Solaris. See the documentation for StTrgMaker:
   $ cd  $STAR/StRoot/StTrgMaker/doc
   $ # Note that intro1.txt is this file that you're currently reading.
   $ more intro2.txt

================================================================
SECTION 3, DO NOT USE THE TRACK EXTENSION SOFTWARE THAT HERB WROTE.

You can use either Solaris or Linux for this.

You need to read the tutorial for StEvent.  StEvent gives you access to
the (trigger) data in the .event.root files.  While reading the tutorial,
pay special attention to the StAnalysisMaker example, which can serve as a
starting point for your own activities, up to and including creating your
own Maker.  Fortunately for us trigger folk, StAnalysisMaker as an example
uses trigger data.

The tutorial is at

The main support for StEvent is Thomas Ullrich (Yale).  I am also
available for questions.

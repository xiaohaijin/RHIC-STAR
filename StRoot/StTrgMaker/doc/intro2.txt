AUTHOR: Herbert Ward, May 29 2001.
INTENDED AUDIENCE: Those wishing to use StTrgMaker for CTB calibration.

First read the file intro1.txt which is this directory.

First, make a working directory, we'll call it "your working directory" below.

If you have your own local makers, they should be in a subdirectory
of your working directory named StRoot.

Below we assume that the .event.root files you want to read are in
the directory /aaa/bbb/ccc.  And, we assume that the run number you
are interested in is 1234567.

cd "your working directory"
set your level of $STAR (starpro, stardev, starnew, or starold).
ln -s ~ward/trig/progs .
cp $STAR/StRoot/StTrgMaker/doc/trigCtb.C .
cp $STAR/StRoot/StTrgMaker/doc/trigRoot.s .
./trigRoot.s /aaa/bbb/ccc/*_1234567_*.event.root

The script trigRoot.s will leave a large ASCII file named
jjTempDir/total.out.  You can run any of the programs in
progs/trk2slat/*.c on this file.  The script runs one of
them for you (progs/trk2slat/overall.c).

<ul>
<li> separate messages by severity level a-la-VMS (informational,
   warning, error and fatal ... may be more but at least those
   people have thought about). This implies
   
   <br> Having a way to enable/disable some severity level
   <br>* Examples:
   <ul>
       <li>  turning all messages of level warning and below OFF
       <li>  directing all FATAL messages to special appender (possible
       hand-shake with ABHA or similar would be what I have in
       mind)
       <li>  moving to /dev/null all informational messages in case
       of batch but not interactive
     </ul>

<li> this causes an immediate dilema: we know our users ... they
   will declare all error as 'fatal' or 'error' if they figure
   that informational are trashed to /dev/null so, we need to
   <ul>
   <li> have a separation by sub-systems such as TPC, FTPC, ...
   <li> we need to have a granularity per maker
   <li> we need to be able to control the AMOUNT of IO in KB, MB
     or whatever else per 'grouping' (Maker, sub-systems, ..).
     This would allow to do things as follow - 
     Examples:
   <ul>
     <li> (really a random example ;-) ) - The sub-system E-EMC
       displays too many messages. After 10 MB of message, all
       messages are disabled in the serverity level ... This
       would not penalize the level fatal or error ... unless
       themselves they do reach some "quota"
     <li> consecutive repeated messages should not be displayed
       and not be accounted as per the IO "quota". Non repeating
       messages is  a feature of our current Messenger by the way.
     <li> A quota may be necessary at any level
       <br> 1 GB total for root4star (to level)
       <br> <a href="RollingQuota.xml">10 MB</a> / sub-system
       <br>  2 MB / sub-system / severity
       <br>Those being adjustable numbers.
     </ul>
    </ul>
<li> Next is applicability. We need to develop an appender
   RIGHT AWAY for initially level 'fatal' and 'warning'.
   We need to relate this to the job tracing activity (one
   more reason people to submit your discussions to the
   list is that the different parts of the projects are
   now coming together) and the GUI activity ...
   <ul>
   <li> We may try to go for some severity level only
   <li> we may try to go for all messages
   <li> we may even try to re-consider the global IO issue
     (i.e. hard limit on N MB) and instead, consider rates
     if possible. This would be MUCH more relevant as per
     what the db back-end can absorb ...
   <ul>

	So, in summary, do we have those features

<ul>
<li> IO hard "quota" per <a href="HardQuota.xml">severity level</a> and per 
<a href="HardQuotaTpc.xml"> sub-systems </a> ??
<li> IO rates "quotas" ??
<ul>

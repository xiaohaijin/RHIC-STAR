Description - EMC Embedding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is the basic embedding scheme for EMC. This maker gets the output
of two StEvent objects and merge the EMC hits of the second StEvent into
the first one. Before doing that, the maker erases all the clusters and
points, so cluster finder and point maker should run again. The order
of the StEvent objects are defined by the macro you are using to run
the maker. See ./macros for examples.

The basic HIT embedding was extracted by an old maker written by Subhasis.

This maker also have full conectivity to the EMC database so it will embed
hits only if the tower is active in the real data. This connectivity can be
disabled, if desired. If disabled, the full detector is active and the program
will embed all hits of the second event into the first.

This maker also has the feature of embed the global and primary tracks of
the second StEvent into the first but THIS IS NOT A TPC EMBED. This feature
can be turned off, if desired.

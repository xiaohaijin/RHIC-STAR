Trigger filter to accept events that fire selected bits of the
output of the EMC layer 2 DSM, EM201. The output is a 16-bit integer
that forms the basis of the trigger decision by the calorimeters.
The definiton of the bits follows (as of Run 9):

  (Bit 0:3) Barrel HT bits (4 bits)
  (4:5) Endcap HT bits (2)
  (6) JP1, unified over the BEMC+EEMC (1)
  (7) JP2, unified over the BEMC+EEMC (1)
  (8) BJP1 for the 18 BEMC-only patches (1)
  (9) BJP2 for the 18 BEMC-only patches (1)
  (10) EJP1 for the 6 EEMC-only patches (1)
  (11) EJP2 for the 6 EEMC-only patches (1)
  (12) AJP for BEMC and EEMC but NOT the boundary (1)
  (13) BAJP for the BEMC-only patches (1)
  (14) EAJP for the EEMC-only patches (1)
  (15) Unused

An example usage is shown in the BFC macro bfcSpin.C that takes as input
a fzd file then process each event through the EMC response.
If the event doesn't fire any selected trigger from the EMC response
alone further reconstruction is aborted at this stage. This is
especially handy to decide whether or not to continue reconstruction of
detectors like the TPC which can be computationally intensive.

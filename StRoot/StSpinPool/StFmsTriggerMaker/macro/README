  runs $yearday                           make runlist for a day in $yearday/run.txt from DB

  root4star -b -q bitcheck.C"($run)"      read trigger data file and do bit check

  runbitcheck $run                        run bitcheck.C and make text files in www/$yearday/*

  makeplot $run				  run TDFReader.C, makeplot.C, gain.C and tac.kumac

  root history.C'($yearday)'              make histrory plot for the day
  root history.C'($yea000)'               make histrory plot for the year

  makepage.pl                just make web page for today (not running qa)

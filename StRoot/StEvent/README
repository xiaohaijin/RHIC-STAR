* StEvent Online Info

The StEvent documentation changes frequently.

The most easy way to get a print ready manual is is to pick up the
PS version of the manual at the following URL:
http://www.star.bnl.gov/STARAFS/comp/root/special_docs.html
At the moment pdf format is not supported on this page.

In order to manually create an up-to-date version do the following:

     mkdir wrk
     cd wrk
     cvs co StRoot/StEvent
     cd StRoot/StEvent/doc/tex
     make

This creates a PS file StEvent.ps which you can print easily. This requires
that you have a complete version of LaTeX installed on your system.
Optionally you can also create directly a pdf file StEvent.pdf:

make pdf

This requires that you have the dvipdf program installed on you system.

For question please send a mail to: thomas.ullrich@yale.edu.

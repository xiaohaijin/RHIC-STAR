Time-stamp: <01/28/00 14:02:55 fisyak>  Introduce the package
Time-stamp: <01/05/07 14:02:55 fisyak>  Rework the package to improve laser drift velocity calculations 

* Package: StLaserAnalysisMaker

* Purpose:
Create TTree with predictions from reconstructed laser tracks at the mirrors, drift velocity calculation for each raft 
(definition of raft can be found in "The laser system for the STAR time projection chamber", 
J. Abel;e et al., NIM A 499 (2003) 692, Fig. 1 "Conseptual design of the laser system") 
* History:
The first release is for Run V, used in P07ib and P07ic production
The release for Run VII
==========================
StLaserAnalysisMaker is maker to produce the TTree
The simplest chain is 
root.exe -q -b 'bfc.C(9999,"LanaDV,ITTF","path_to_st_laser_daq_file")'
(run for 10 events only is not advisable because it could be no laser tracks at all for this no. of events)
macros:
LoopOverLaserTrees.C+("./st_laser_*.tags.root")-- analysis of TTree files (*tags.root) and produce tpcDriftVelocity.*.C
CheckLasers.C                                  -- compare Alexei table for mirror position and 
                                                  one obtained from a bunch of local to master transformations
CheckMirrors.C+("./st_laser_*.tags.root")      -- calculate difference between laser track prediction and mirror position
ConverL.C                                      -- recalculate Alexei table into bunch of transformation
Db2NtDv.C                                      -- look for correlation between TPC gas parameters in DB and drift velocities 
Laser.C                                        -- production of  tpcDriftVelocity.*.C for Run V
RaftMirror.C                                   -- adjustment raft, bundle, mirror positions

**** TOF INL/TDIG database workflow ****

* determine timestamp (typically assigned by S&C coordinator at run-start)
* double check the following ingredients:
*  - tray replacements, i.e. geom tray ID has a new tray w/ different SN
*     double check with yearly spreadsheet at
*     http://www.star.bnl.gov/public/tof/electronics/index.html
*     Action: modify the macro
*  - TDIG replacements on TOF trays:  tdig_yyyymmdd.txt extracted 
*     from the TOF database at http://www.rhip.utexas.edu/~tofp/tray
*     Action: request file update, or edit original in case of minor changes
*  - TDIG replacements on VPDs
*     verify VPD pdf file at
*     http://www.star.bnl.gov/public/tof/electronics/index.html
*     Action: modify the macro

root4star -b -l -q macros/storetofTDIGOnTray.C
diff testTDIGMap.dat with earlier version
setenv DB_ACCESS_MODE write
root4star -b -l -q macros/storetofTDIGOnTray.C


**** TFO/VPD triggerwindow update ****
* determine the window (typical size ~75ns) in which the VPD
* and BTOF see hits. For uniform HTPDC configurations, these
* should be uniform per THUB, but individual trays (read:
*  VPD "trays") could have non-default values
* Update typically once, ahead of the new run period

root4star -b -l -q  'macros/storetofTrgWindow.C'



**** TOF alignment workflow ****
* determine timestamp (usually only once per run period)
* increment seconds in case of a new version
* update store macro with new location (and recommit to CVS)
root4star -b -l -q 'macros/storetofGeomAlign.C'
root4star -b -l -q 'macros/readtofGeomAlign.C("2011-01-01 00:00:00")'


**** TOF calibration database workflow ****

* determine timestamp
* increment seconds in case of a new version
* point the input soft link to the correct subdirectory

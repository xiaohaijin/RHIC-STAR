Package: St_TLA_Maker
Responsible: Victor Perevoztchikov (perev@bnl.gov)

Purpose: Template Maker doing nothing.

Provides template for creation any user maker.

1) Inherited from StMaker class

2) User must provide at least its own methods

  a) Init()  	//mandatory
  b) Make()  	//mandatory
  c) InitRun(newRunNumber) 	//if needed
  d) FinishRun(oldRunNumber) 	//if needed
  e) Clear() 	//if standard StMaker::Clear()  is not appropriate  
  f) Finish()	//if standard StMaker::Finish() is not appropriate 

3) User can define any other methods, but regularly they
   should not be used by others makers. But some of them
   could be used from Cint macro or root prompt
   If possible, user method must be private. 

TLA - Triple Letter Acronym. 

In previous notation user module name must have 3 letters
surrounded by "_".

Now this limitation is obsolete. User maker now must be:

St<User provided name>Maker
User name must be separated by the following methods:

  a) StXxxxxMaker

  b) St_xxxxx_Maker
  
But actually it is only for clarity. Essential parts
are only "St" and "Maker"

This directory contains the Highpt uDST Maker developed by Bum Choi.  It creates
highpt uDSTs (StHiMicroEvent) from StEvent for inclusive spectra analysis.  

The first committed version has been updated for Year 2 analysis, including
year 2 definition of centrality.

Added new members to StHiMicroEvent to save zdc vertex info which is now filled here.  

Also changed the way centrality is determined - it now uses the standard 
uncorrectedNumberOfPrimaries(*stEvent) function from StuRefMult.h in StEventUtilities.

Finally, added a boolean selection for the user to decide whether to write out
event information for events which have no primary vertex.  
These might be useful in assessing the vertex finding efficiency for low multiplicity
events using the zdcvertex information.

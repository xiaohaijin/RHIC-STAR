Pythia filtering.
Details are given here:
http://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/subsys/upgr/fgt/filtering-pythia-events-starsim

is done by instering a custom fortran code in to a private directory and add/replace the following files (remove '-example')

pyevnt.F-example 
star_filter.inc-example
star_filter.F-example

Those files needs to be customized for end-user needs.
Macro 
 plotPythia.kumac can be used to visalaise HBOOK histos from Pythia+GSTAR job tomonitor rejection factor.

Macros generate various physics samples. 
ppWdec.kumac  ppWprod.kumac  ppZjet.kumac
ppQCDprod.kumac   ppWjet.kumac  ppWZ.kumac     ppZprod.kumac

Macro
skimMultiLogs.tcl 
allows to fetch some variables from the log files, needed for integrated luminosity

Macros:
bsub_gstar_bfc.sh big_mcRun.sh
allow massive submission of jobs vis LSF @ RCF

========================================================
This bfc.C was taken from dev in April of 2008,
It has been modified to work with M-C events and
to make use of the EndcapFilterMaker which aborts events if too little energy is seen in the endcap.
Note, this BFC uses also beam line constrain shifted off x=y=0 - a special DB table is used for that.

Search for string 'JAN' to find where bfc.c was changed.

The goal is to reduce the footprint of output files.
For example for QCD events partonic pt 10-30, already filtered on the pythia level by requirement 20 GeV ET (true energy) we can get another factor of ~20 in the reduction if Endcap response >16 GeV (using SF=1.0) is imposed in BFC.

For QCD events with partonic pt 30-inf generated the same way, we win factor 6.3 in filter-1 and factor 1.5 in filter-2.

For W-event we win factor of 3.

I run the following BFC options:

bsub -q star_cas_big -J Qcd-b3 -o LogBb3 root4star -b -q bfc.C'(1000,"DbV20080310 trs -ssd upgr13  Idst IAna l0 tpcI fcf -ftpc Tree logger ITTF Sti StiRnd  -IstIT -SvtIt -NoSvtIt SvtCL,svtDb -SsdIt MakeEvent McEvent geant evout geantout IdTruth  bbcSim emcY2 EEfs bigbig -dstout fzin -MiniMcMk McEvOut clearmem -ctbMatchVtx VFPPV eemcDb beamLine","/star/institutions/iucf/balewski/2008-FGT-simu/setC5-pilot/mit0018_3_5000evts.fzd")'

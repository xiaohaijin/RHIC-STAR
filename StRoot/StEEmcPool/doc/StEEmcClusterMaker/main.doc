 \section steemcclustermaker_towers Tower, pre- and postshower algorithm

 The clustering-algorithm used for tower clusters (as well as preshower 
 and postshower clusters) is the 
 <a href="http://www.star.bnl.gov/STAR/eemc/simulations/MineSweeper/">Minesweeper</a>
 algorithm originally developed by Jan Balewski. 

 \section steemcclustermaker_smd The SMD Algorithm

 The SMD clustering algorithm starts by finding all strips which 
 exceed a user-specified seed threshold.  These strips are sorted
 by energy, and we work from the most energetic seed to the least
 energetic seed.

 Strips adjacent to the smd seed are added to the cluster and removed
 from the pool of seed strips.  The number of adjacent strips added
 is specified by the user in the setMaxExtent(max) method.

 Once a cluster is identified, the seed threshold is raised in the
 vicinity of that cluster.  For details, see buildSmdClusters().

 \section steemcclustermaker_smd_cuts SMD Cluster Cuts

 In order to form a cluster, we require a minimum of three smd strips.
 Fewer strips suggests a MIP, although low-energy EM showers (<~ 1 GeV)
 can deposit energy in only two consecutive smd strips.

 The user may also specify the suppress() option for the cluster
 maker.  When this option is used, the two smd strips adjacent to
 the cluster are removed from the pool of smd seed strips.  This
 reduces the effects of false cluster splitting, i.e. where a 
 fluctuation in the size of the EM shower combined with the fixed
 size of the cluster leads to the formation of a false smd cluster.

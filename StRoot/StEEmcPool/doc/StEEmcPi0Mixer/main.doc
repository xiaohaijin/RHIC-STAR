\mainpage StEEmcPi0Mixer - Produces two-body kinematics from pairs of EEMC points.

 This class takes as input points found using StEEmcPointMaker or
a derivative class.  We then loop over all possible pairs of 
points to find pi0 (eta) --> gamma gamma candidates.  

 Points from
each event are stored in a E_T ranked pool, which we then mix
to form combinatoric background candidates.  In the future we
may create a separate maker for mixed events.

The code allows two cuts:

<ol>
  <li>Trigger list -- the user may specify a list of triggers to process</li>
  <li>Sector limits -- by default, points are mixed if in the same sector.  The user may specify other sector-wise limits.</li>
</ol>

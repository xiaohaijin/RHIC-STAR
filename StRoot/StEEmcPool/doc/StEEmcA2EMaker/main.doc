\section intro Introduction

   This is a set of classes which provides a convienent way to represent EEMC data.
The StEEmcA2EMaker is the core object, reading in events from either the MuDst
or StEvent formats.  Support for EZtree branches of the MuDst may be added in
the future.

   StEEmcA2EMaker reads in the raw ADC values and accesses the databse for each
detector element to lookup the pedestal and gain.  For every detector element
(tower, pre/postshower, smd) the pedestal will be subtracted.  The raw
and pedestal-subtracted ADC values will be saved into an StEEmcTower or
StEEmcStrip object (as appropriate).  Detector elements which 

1. Are not marked with a "fail" bit in the database, and

2. Exceed a user-specified threshold above pedestal

are corrected for gains.  For towers, we store the equivalent electromagnetic
energy in GeV.  For preshower/postshower elements and SMD strips, we 
record the energy deposited in GeV.  

   Access to the reconstructed energy (or energy deposit) is through member functions
of StEEmcA2EMaker.

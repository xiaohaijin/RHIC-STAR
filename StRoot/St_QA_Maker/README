QAhlist_*.h files are used by StHistUtil to determine which histograms to
draw. They are located here because the names of the histograms should all
be kept here in the St_QA_Maker package as much as possible, not burried
in StHistUtil.

StQAMakerBase is the base class for the QA makers:
St_QA_Maker    : uses tables
StEventQAMaker : uses StEvent

StQAMakerBase contains any histograms which are not multiplicity-specific.
StQABookHist contains histograms to be made for each multiplicity.

StQAMakerBase uses instances of StQABookHist for each multiplicity class
it will be analyzing. Both StQABookHist and StQAMakerBase use the QAH
class's static functions to instantiate the histograms with the appropriate
names and titles.

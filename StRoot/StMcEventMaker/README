Modification History
====================

06/28/99 Original version. Authors: Mike Lisa, Manuel Calderon de la Barca Sanchez

Description
===========
Fills the StMcEvent objects.
Presently, it only uses .geant.root files.
The tree is filled starting from the vertex table.
After that, tracks are filled and the proper
relationship between tracks and their vertices is
established.  Then, hits are filled and set to point
to their appropriate track.

To be done
==========
The g2t_event table was not being filled at the time
of the writing, so it has been discarded.  If necessary,
then the reading should be modified to take this table
into account.

Tests done
----------
Compiles on hp_ux102, sun4x_56 and i386_redhat51.

Tauola C++ Interface - Examples
-------------------------------

1)
To compile:
-  "./configure"
-  "make"

2)
Examples require more software than interface itself:

./configure --with-hepmc=<path>          - provides path for HepMC
./configure --with-tauola=<path>         - provides path for Tauola++
./configure --with-pythia8=<path>        - provides path for Pythia8
./configure --with-mc-Tester=<path>      - provides path for MC-Tester

To use MC-Tester, ROOT must be installed and
its path provided via PATH variable.

To use examples with HepMC Tauola++ must be compiled with HepMC as well.
Otherwise examples will fail during compilation.

3)
If afs paths was used during interface compilation,
all these paths are set alredy and 
can not be changed.

4)
Examples require:
taumain_hepevt_example.exe     - does not require any new libraries
taumain_standalone_example.exe - require HepMC
single_tau_gun_example.exe     - require HepMC, Pythia8
taumain_pythia_example.exe     - require HepMC, Pythia8, ROOT and MC-Tester

The currdelphi.for file contains the formfactors for 4-pion final states
as fitted by Frans Verbeure of Delphi. 

It was used in the following publication:
A study of the hadronic resonance structure in the decay
$\tau\rightarrow 3\pi\nu_{\tau}$, P. Abreu et al., Phys. Lett. B426
(1998) 411 

It is strongly recommended to reproduce some numbers from this paper before using the code.
Note that the entries from common blocks  PARMAS DECPAR are used in currdelphi.for
and if modified (e.g. modern defaults used), may lead to different results. 

Please contact  VERBEURE@vxcern.cern.ch  when using this code.

Subject: Tauola modelling of tau->nu(Kpipi)- decays...

Hello,
 
I am a research associate working with the
OPAL collaboration with the High Energy
Physics group at Carleton University.  I was
responsible for the OPAL analysis of three
prong tau decays with charged kaons, described
in hep-ex/9908013.
 
A crucial aspect of the analysis was the
modifications I made to TAUOLA to take into
account the severe phase-space restrictions inherent
in decay modes like K1(1270)->rho(770)K.  Taking
into account the phase space restrictions shifts the
mean of K1(1270) peak down in the Kpipi invariant mass
spectrum, and also shifts the mean of the rho(770) peak
in the pipi mass spectrum.  Confusion has arisen in
past analyses (for example, DELPHI's preliminary analysis
of the tau->nu K-pi-pi+ state, presented at TAU 96), when it 
was noticed that the Kpipi invariant mass spectrum 
appeared consistent with K1(1270)
dominance, but that the peak in the pipi invariant mass 
spectrum lay below the naively expected mass of 770 MeV.

I have set up a web page at 
   http://www.physics.carleton.ca/~smjt/res.html
which describes the ansatz used to take the
phase space restrictions into account, and also
the modifications made to TAUOLA in the OPAL
analysis.

I would imagine that the the large tau samples 
expected to be collected in the near future by 
the various B factory experiments will require 
more accurate modelling of the tau->nu(Kpipi)- final
states than what is currently available.  Thus
I thought that, before I move on from my position at
Carleton, I should contact you, and let you know
what modifications were made in the OPAL analysis.
 
I hope this saves you (or someone else) a little work.
 
Best regards,
 
Sherry Towers

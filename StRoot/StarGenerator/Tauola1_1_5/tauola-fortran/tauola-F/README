This set-up is generating directory of tauola library.
Tauola sources may be built in one of the options mentioned below.
.F sources are preprocessed using cpp precompiler and stored in 
prod/ subdirectory.


Basic options are:
       make CPC
       make CLEO 
       make ALEPH
========================

As result:


1) contents of existing external tauola/ subdirectory is erased (!)
2) directory structure of external tauola/ is rebuilt: 
3) directory prod/ is filled with appropriate fortran files and makefiles.
2) interfaces to KK and main stand-alone programs are created
3) external tauola/ directory is filled with fortran and makefiles.
4) external tauola/ sub-directories are filled with fortran code of demos
5) external tauola/KK-face is filled with fortran code of KK interface

make: Tauface 
=============

Tauface.f will be placed in KK2f directory.

Remarks:
========

1) All machine dependant settings are stored in TAUOLA/make.inc and
    TAUOLA/platform/
2) Makefiles templates  are compatible with KK: thus by executing 
   make makflag from KK/ffbench/ will overwrite makefile in tauola/ 
   with the one produced from makefile.templ files.
3) demo and test programs do not know of KK. They use compiler settings
   from TAUOLA/make.inc

4) WARNING! 
   ++++++++
   The code of tauola and demos may need special compiler flags, when ported
   to another platform. 
5) Additional parametrizations of form-factors which can be useful
   in some applications are stored in directory suppl. They are not
   ready to use and some care cross checks are mandatory.

===========
execute: 'make pythia' for pythia demonstration code. 
'demo-pythia' will be created in the 'tauola' directory

- Photos and Tauola have their own copies of random number generators,
  which are placed in include files of this directory.
- To change it is enough to replace the
      photos-random.h
      tauola-random.h 
  with the files including the appropriate new (interfacing) subroutines of
  random  generators of the user choice or including empty file if 
  the generators of the same name reside elsewhere.

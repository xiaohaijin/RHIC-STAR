This set-up is generating directory of tauola library, new line of
development starting Oct 09 2004.
Tauola sources may be built in one of the options mentioned below.
.F sources are preprocessed using cpp precompiler and stored in 
prod/ subdirectory.


Basic options are:
       make authors
       make BaBar
       make Belle
they will create the same files at this moment
========================

As result:


1) contents of existing external tauola/ subdirectory is erased (!)
2) directory structure of external tauola/ is rebuilt: 
3) directory prod/ is filled with appropriate fortran files and makefiles.
2) interfaces to KK and main stand-alone programs are created
3) external tauola/ directory is filled with fortran and makefiles.
4) external tauola/ sub-directories are filled with fortran code of demos
5) external tauola/KK-face is filled with fortran code of KK interface

make: Tauface 
=============

Tauface.f will be placed in KK2f directory.

Remarks:
========

1) All machine dependant settings are stored in TAUOLA/make.inc and
    TAUOLA/platform/
2) Makefiles templates  are compatible with KK: thus by executing 
   make makflag from KK/ffbench/ will overwrite makefile in tauola/ 
   with the one produced from makefile.templ files.
3) demo and test programs do not know of KK. They use compiler settings
   from TAUOLA/make.inc

4) WARNING! 
   ++++++++
   The code of tauola and demos may need special compiler flags, when ported
   to another platform. 
5) Additional parametrizations of form-factors which can be useful
   in some applications are stored in directory suppl. They are not
   ready to use and some care cross checks are mandatory.

Remarks on physics update:
==========================

1)
  There were 40+20 empty new slots (and one filled in) prepared for tauola running.
  At present they are initialized with some dummy stuff, which make them running
  but into unphysical configurations only.
2) Nonetheless  the defaults for KKMC governing tau decays are not changed, re-mapping is done at tauola 
   initialization. Tauface.f file of KKMC need change of course
3) All phase space masses and flavours can be initialized in routine INITDK as always.
   The matrices IDFFIN(9,NMODE),MULPIK(NMODE) are appropriately extended for that, this applies to all chanels
   presented below.

4) The new slot is for tau decay to pi-pi0pi0  is at the position 72 it has the same current as for channel 
   5 but it can be now indepenently recoded, thus can have  different current than for channel 5 (pi+pi-pi-).
   It is defined now for mnum=9 as defined in functions form1-form5, overall coeficients for the 
   contributions to the current are defined (again for mnum=9) in routine  F3PI. The overall coeficients
   are  defined in routine  DAMPPK wit the help of usual coefficients FNORM(0:19),COEF(1:5,0:19);
   values at FNORM(9) and at COEF(1:5,9);
5) extra 10 channels for 3 scalars  are prepared, they can be initialized using the same formfactors and coefficients
   as in case of pi-pi0pi0, but for positions mnum=10 to 19. Dummy initializations for these channels is giving
   now  charged non conserving final state pi0pi0pi0, they corrrspond to positions 53 to 62 for branching ratios
6) extra 10 channels for n pions (it does not need to be 6!) are initialized at positions 54 to 63 of branching ratios
   the appropriate inclusive spectra for dGamma/d(Q**2) are to be filled in in routine sigee(Q2,JNP)
   for JNP from 7 to 16, the line in routine sigee:
        IF(JNPI.GT.6) JNPI=6  ! warning
   has to be replaced.  these channels write into hepevt 3pi-3pi+ or 2pi-2pi+2pi0.
7) extra 20 channels for 4 scalars in list of branching ratios are at positions 10 to 29 of branching ratios
   Their current ha to be provied in routine CURR_CLEO(MNUM,PIM1,PIM2,PIM3,PIM4,HADCUR), for mnum=3  to 22,
   at present dumily mnum=2 for every of this cases, thus the current for pi-pi0pi0pi0p, the phase space factor 
   1/6 has to be checked, if activated these channels put 3 pions and one Kaon into  the event record. 
8) extra 20 channels for 5 scalars in list of branching ratios they are at positions 31 to 50 of branching ratios
   the current  CURR5 can be used for that purpose, for the consecutive slots 31 to 50 dam5pi get the index
   from 24 to 43. If activated these channels write into HEPEVT decays into one Kaon and 4 pions.
9) Note that for 5pi channel 30 crappy matrix element is used as in old tauola.  From routine  DPH5PI
   condition
       if (jnpi.gt.13) !
     $ CALL DAM5PI(
   should be removed and current CURR5 should be used and initialized for  jnpi=23 exactly as in point 8)
9) extra 10 channels for 2 scalars in list of branching ratios they are at positions 84 to 93 of branching ratios
   current has to be adjusted in  DPHSRK parameter inum can be used to distinguish, but it is not done so far.
   non-standard dcays like mu+mu+mu- are to be placed there (?), but some work on neutrino flavour in storing 
   and in mass setting has to be done still. If activated these events write in HEPEVT tau decays into K-K-

I hope that this file explains more than confuses ...

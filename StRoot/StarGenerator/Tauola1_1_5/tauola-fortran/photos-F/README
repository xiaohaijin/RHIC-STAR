This is directory photos-F for PHOTOS adaptation to HEPEVT common block format.

The true output is photos.f file which contains all fortran code.

The possible options are: KK   -- for KK monte carlo
                          4kD  -- dimension  4000 double precision
                          2kR  -- dimension  2000 single precision
                         10kD  -- dimension 10000 double precision

This functionality is assured with the help of cpp pre-compiler which creates
photos.f file from photos.F appropriate path to cpp must be updated in makefile

It is possible to run 'make' and 'make run' from directory demo,
but this is only after appropriate flags for compilation are set 
in sub directory demo and directory photos-F.

The directory photos-F can be placed instead of standard photos directory
this was checked eg. in KK env to work properly. Then, appropriate 
redristribution of flags is assured; makefile.template is of KK-style. 

The agressive form of creating working photos directory (directory
../photos) is by executing 
make KK-all, make 4kD-all, make 2kR-all, make 10kD-all,

note that then original directory located at ../photos will be erased

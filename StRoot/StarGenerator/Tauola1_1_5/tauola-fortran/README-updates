tauface-jetset.F:  non-automatic definition of the common block. Corrected.

Corrections thanks to J. Holt for sign of costhe introduced.

Corrections thanks to J. Holt for search outside the HEPEVT matrices introduced.

PHOTOS:

Emission from quarks introduced as option special function
C--   can be executed after calling PHOINI
C--   blocks emission from quarks if parameter is 1 (enables if 2), physical treatment
C--   will be 3, option 2 is not realistic and for tests only, 
      IDUM= IPHQRK(1)   ! default is 1

Emission in decay of pi0  to gamma e+ e- blocked, other blocking entries are easy 
to place also
C--   can be executed after calling PHOINI
C--   blocks emission in  pi0 to gamma e+ e- if parameter is 1 (enables if 2)
      IDUM= IPHEKL(1)   ! default is 1

Interface to Pythia available. It can be activated by command 
             make pythia
of  directory tauola-F
at present it works automaitically for HEPEVT dimension 2000 double precision.

May .. 2001 
   Bug in the sigh of cos_theta for tau polarization was corrected.
This was not made public until Aug 25 2001 (or even later) 


Aug 20  2001

To add Novosibirsk parametrization to any versions of TAUOLA available till today
special directory tauola-factory was added. 
In every version cleo aleph cpc parametrization of the form-factors for 
pi+pi+pi-pi0 and pi+3pi0 can be replaced with the ones based on Novosibirsk data
and parametrization.

Before calling make cpc (cleo aleph) in directory tauola-F   (see documentation)
command ./glue in directory 
  tauola-factory 
should be executed.

Aug 25  2001

The spin effects in states of tau+ tau- produced from eplicit or imlicit 
Z/gamma states were upgraded up to nearly KORALZ standards. Photons can 
be merged either with beams OR with taus.

Bug was fixed, in previous versions photons were wrongly asociated with other
beams. This was leading to not very significant miscalcuation of cos_theta
(for function calculating tau polarization).

Feb 2002

  Interface for full spin treatment in Higgs boson decay (scalar or 
  pseudoscalar) is added, it does not change mode of the program use.

  Some minor bug fixing was introduced. 

  Patch for HEPEVT, alowing program to run properly when second 
  daughter pointer of tau mother is undefined was added.

Thanks to Caterine Biscarat and Tania Moulik for tests and 
suggestions. Further improvement of the universal interface 
in cases  like: H --> ZZ, Z --> tau tau Z, or production
of heavy boson pairs will be introduced in future versions 
only. There are many possibilities and physics precision 
goals are probably not so great. Dominant spin effects are 
anyway in. 

Dec 21, 2002, 
Thanks to tests necessary for future developments numerically 
minor bug was found, see pi+pi+pi-pi0-fix.ps.gz for details. 

Jan 21, 2003, 
we have found some problems in Novosibirsk parametrization. 
We work on this point now. Done at unspecified time. 

Feb 10, 2003, 
the points discussed under dates Jan 21, 2003, and Dec 21, 2002, 
are partially solved (still no updates on 
control outputs etc.) you need to replace sub-directory
TAUOLA/tauola-factory with the content of tauola-factory.tgz 
file. Later you have to execute (in sub-directory 
TAUOLA/tauola-factory ) ./glue standard command. 



Apr 02 2003   
Update of PHOTOS weight in W decays as described in 
CERN-TH/2003-075 are introduced, also correction
in default of a key for bremsstrahlung in pi0 decays
was corrected.

Corrections of Jan 21, 2003, Dec 21, 2002, fully integrated.
All demo outputs for all TAUOLA versions are reproduced on RH 7.3.1
CERN distribution.

Corrections of universal interface in case of taus having taus
as mothers are not installed yet, may be other solutions
outside the interface would be better. 

Apr 07 2003
Comment printouts added to PHOTOS,
Corrections to TAUOLA universal interface necessary to run for some
options of PYTHIA not yet added. The same is true for use of interface 
with  HERWIG. This items are expected to be updated by summer LHC
MC workshop.

June 25,2003 
New version of tauface-jetset.F
which work with all versions of PYTHIA ways of filling HEPEVT common block 
(as well as with HERWIG way). It survived tests by users, special thanks to 
Borut Kersevan and also S. Slabospitsky. 

July 28,2003 
extensions for the Higgs boson decay, see preprint CERN-TH/2003-166 for details.  

Nov 24 2003
All corrections updates and new features as in preprint 
P. Golonka et al CERN-TH 2003-287 hep-ph/0312240 are included.

Jan 25 2004
Consistency checks on outputs etc completed.

PHOTOS:



With the extension of PHOTOS to new functionalities the following changes 
in input parameters were introduced and initialization is hard coded as usual 
in routine PHOCIN: 
1) ITRE=.FALSE. Third/fourth order - triple (or quatric) photon switch, see 
   dipswitch IFOUR=(.TRUE.).AND.(ITRE) in routine PHTYPE 
2) IEXP=.FALSE. to activate option with multiple photon emission. This option 
   will set: 
           CALL PHCORK(5) ! see below for definition. 
   In case of exponentiation this option is a default because in most cases 
   it is necessary. 
           XPHCUT=0.000 000 1 
           EXPEPS=1D-4 
3) see photos-F/numericalStability.html for more details.

TAUOLA:
  New version of the generating package created, called TAUOLA-BBB
it operates exactly as TAUOLA-F and is prepared for managing new versions:
 authors, BaBar and Belle

# Feb 26, 2005 Version 2.13 with better interference, which now work in every channel is ready. 
Documentation is in hep-ph/0506026 and file with the code is: photos.F . This version with some tests 
completed just recently, is still not integrated with the rest of the distribution package, demo outputs 
etc have to be re-run. At present one has to copy photos.F-260205 file into directory TAUOLA/photos-F 
of The Package with older distribution files.


# Aug 24, 2005 We continued testsof PHOTOS, and version 2.14 with just single patch with respect to 2.13 
introduced:  photos.F . This version is with lots of tests completed, but is still not integrated with the 
rest of the distribution package, demo outputs etc have to be re-run, we plan upgrade of TAUOLA before end 
of holidays. At present one has to copy photos.F file into directory TAUOLA/photos-F of  The Package with 
older distribution files.

September 22 2005

directory tauola-BBB updated with semi-realistic currents for 5pi final states. (TAUOLA v. 2.9)
Photos 2.14 integrated into package.
Interface enriched with possible decays into eta K0_S and PI0 ...  (INTERFACE v. 1.21)


April 24 2009

Minor updates to make package working with gfortran. The main changes were in universal interface.
Mismatches of variable types between calling and defining routines were fixed. That was not a problem 
for g77. No physics updates were included. Further changes are expected once C++ interfaces are ready.
Also experience with gfortran should be consolidated by that time.

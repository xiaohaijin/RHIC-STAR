This constructor utility for
	TAUOLA & PHOTOS & ciekawostka
is for software librarians and advanced users interested in updating
the programs in multipurpose environment.
=====================================================================

It manages versioning of the tau lepton decay library TAUOLA and generator 
for radiative corrections in decays PHOTOS. Care is taken of the main source, 
interfaces in different applications as well as makefiles and compiler 
flags etc. 

It is expected that the user will create her/his version of tauola
and photos libraries (subdirectories tauola and photos) and the rest will 
be erased/stored.

Reasons for versions:
=====================

PHOTOS: Versions of PHOTOS are motivated by the different versions of HEPEVT 
        common block. Versions of HEPEVT are set in TAUOLA also.

TAUOLA: Versions are motivated by the different physics options:

1) tauola as published in Comp. Phys. Commun.
2) tauola as initialized by ALEPH collaborations (see printout of this 
   version for details, it is suggested to use this version only with 
   the help of the collaboration advice). this is not active
3) tauola as intialized by CLEO collaborations (see printout of this 
   version for details).


1a. Content of the main directory.
=================================

Before action of package is taken:
-----------------------------------

README            : the file you're reading.
make.inc          : machine-dependent switches of compilers. See point 2 below.
platform/         : directory containing all machine-dependent versions of
                    make.inc files for all other supported platforms.
photos-F/         : main directory containing PHOTOS code with options
tauola-F/         : main directory containing TAUOLA code with options.

glibk/            : histograming package
jetset/           : JETSET MC to be replaced, used for demos only.
randg/            : include.h files for random generators of TAUOLA
                    and PHOTOS
include/          : include files for options of HEPEVT as used in the program
tauola-factory/   : include files needed to add Novosibirsk parametrization 
                    to any versions of TAUOLA

Directories created by the package
-----------------------------------

tauola/           : standard directory with Fortran code of PHOTOS MC and its
                    demo.

tauola/demo-standalone : standalone demo program for TAUOLA		
tauola/demo-jetset     : universal interface; demo program use JETSET generator
tauola/demo-KK-face    : interface to KK monte Carlo 
tauola/demo-pythia     : interface to pythia 6.4

photos/           : standard directory with Fortran code of PHOTOS MC and its
                    demo.



2. INSTALLATION.
================

1) It is safer to execute at the beginning make Clean from main directory 
   to secure against mismatches. 
2) PHOTOS and TAUOLA have their own private random generators. You
   can replace them with the wrappers of your own one. The appropriate
   subroutines are placed in directory 
       randg
   and the files to modify are: 
       tauola-random.h
       photos-random.h

3) Platform dependent stuff must be checked. 
   -Go to subdirectory platform/ 
   -Determine if make-xxx.inc file specific for your computer is present there;   
    for LINUX it is make-linux.inc, for AIX it is make-aix.inc
    for other you need to clone/write it.
    Erase symbolic link make.inc existing in this directory and create a new
    one which points to chosen make-xxx.inc:
			rm make.inc
		for LINUX:	
			ln -s make-linux.inc make.inc
		for AIX:
			ln -s make-aix.inc   make.inc
   check whether the ln -s /platform/make.inc make.inc is present in the
   main directory
4) Later, the easiest is to use shortcut: 
   - go to directory photos-F
   - Run one of these to make a choice for the  version (and hepevt)
       make KK-all:   (for older versions of KKMC interface)
       make 4kD-all:  
       make 2kR-all:  
       make 2kD-all:  
       make 10kD-all: 
   - go to directory tauola-F:
   - execute one of these
       make cpc
       make cleo
       make aleph
   - the directories tauola and photos are created for you. You will not
     need the rest anymore.
   - Note that after that all /tauola /photos stuff will be replaced from
   - scratch. The original ones, if present, will disapear at this poin.
   - Note that the KK interface is hepevt blind, as it uses KK routine 
     where dimensionality is set.
   - =========
   - Demo for photos is ivoked in ./photos/demo
     by command make and later make run
   - Demo for tauola stand-alone is in ./tauola/demo-standalone
   - and can be invoked by command make and later make run
   - simmilarily demo in ./tauola/demo-jetset.
   - interface to KK has to be moved:
     ./tauola/KK-face/Tauface.f to ./KK2f/Tauface.f  of KK/.
   - Demo for pythia is created by executing 'make pythia' in the 'tauola-F' 
     subdirectory

3. Let us continue with some instructive, even if not always needed details.
============================================================================

   go back to TAUOLA dir and verify that symbolic link make.inc exist:
	ls -l make.inc
   it should print
	make.inc -> platform/make.inc
   If make.inc is not present, make this link:
	ln -s platform/make.inc .
		
4. How to run tauola and photos demos
=====================================

1) Go to newly created ./photos/ and execute 'make' to compile 
   and link photos library
2) Enter ./photos/demo/ subdirectory and execute 'make' there to compile 
   photos demo.   Execute 'make run' to run the demo.
3) Go to newly created ./tauola/ and execute 'make' to compile 
   and link tauola library
4) Enter ./tauola/demo-standalone/ subdirectory and execute 'make' there to compile 
   tauola demo.   Execute 'make run' to run the demo.
5) Enter ./tauola/demo-jetset and execute make to compile demo,
   execute make run to run the demo.
7) Output for example demos were constructed under linux red-hat 6.0
   Note, that in older published versions tau-mass=1.7842 GeV was often used.

5. UNSUPPORTED PLATFORMS.
=========================
To move tauola to another machine, one needs to provide make.inc
file with proper compiler, linker and preprocessor switches.
Please observe make-xxx.inc files in TAUOLA/platform as exemplary ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. 
================

Demo and initialization files: Tauface.F tauola_photos_ini.F taumain.F  
can be updated out of text blocks. See README and script 'klej' in directory
./demo-factory. This is necessary if one want to change input for tauola in a consistent
way for all applications: demo-KK-face, demo-standalone, demo-jetset.

7.
=====================
To add Novosibirsk parametrization to any versions of TAUOLA available till today
special directory tauola-factory was added. Before calling make cpc (cleo aleph) 
in directory tauola-F   (see documentation),
command ./glue in directory   tauola-factory should be executed.

8. This system was written by:
=============================

Piotr Golonka, Elzbieta Richter-Was, Zbigniew Was since Feb 2002 also by
Tomasz Pierzchala and Malgorzata Worek.

Physics content of the generators and interfaces is not modified.
Only universal interface of tauola through hepevt is new, as well as potional
parametrization of 4pi currents with Novosibirsk data.

Photos C++ Interface
--------------------
Web page  http://photospp.web.cern.ch

Documentation is in documentation/latex_documentation, type "make" there

To compile the interface:
- Execute "./configure" (if the path to HepMC is not set with
                        HEPMCLOCATION, use "./configure --with-hepmc=<path>"
                        or use "./configure --without-hepmc")
- Execute "make"

--------------------------------------
  Alternatively cofiguration scripts based on autotools can be used.
  In this case 'cd platform', './use-LCG-config.sh' and             
  follow the instructions in the freshly created './INSTALL' readme file.
  The configure file in the directory 'examples' will be absent.         
  The instructions collected below should be then ignored.               
  Under MAC OS one may need to remove '-lfreetype' from                  
  'examples/Makefile'                                                    
-------------------------------------- 

To run the examples, "cd examples". There "./configure" and "make" as well.
For some of the examples to work, pythia8.1 and MC-Tester will be needed.
The most basic example does not need them.

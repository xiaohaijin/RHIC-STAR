<chapter name="Event Information">

<h2>Event Information</h2>

The <code>Info</code> class collects various one-of-a-kind information, 
some relevant for all events and others for the current event. 
An object <code>info</code> is a public member of the <code>Pythia</code>
class, so if you e.g. have declared <code>Pythia pythia</code>, the
<code>Info</code> methods can be accessed by 
<code>pythia.info.method()</code>. Most of this is information that 
could also be obtained e.g. from the event record, but is here more
directly available. It is primarily intended for processes generated 
internally in PYTHIA, but many of the methods would work also for
events fed in via the Les Houches Accord.

<h3>List information</h3>

<method name="void Info::list()">
a listing of most of the information set for the current event. 
</method>

<h3>The beams</h3>

<method name="int Info::idA()">
</method>
<methodmore name="int Info::idB()">
the identities of the two beam particles. 
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::pzA()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::pzB()">
the longitudinal momenta of the two beam particles.
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::eA()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::eB()">

</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::mA()">

</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::eCM()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::s()">
the CM energy and its square for the two beams. 
</methodmore>

<h3>Initialization</h3>

<method name="bool Info::tooLowPTmin()">
normally false, but true if the proposed <ei>pTmin</ei> scale was too low 
in timelike or spacelike showers, or in multiparton interactions. In the 
former case the <ei>pTmin</ei> is raised to some minimal value, in the 
latter the initialization fails (it is impossible to obtain a minijet 
cross section bigger than the nondiffractive one by reducing 
<ei>pTmin</ei>).
</method>

<h3>The event type</h3>

<method name="string Info::name()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="int Info::code()">
the name and code of the process that occured.
</methodmore>

<method name="int Info::nFinal()"> 
the number of final-state partons in the hard process.
</method>

<method name="bool Info::isResolved()"> 
are beam particles resolved, i.e. were PDF's used for the process?
</method>

<method name="bool Info::isDiffractiveA()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="bool Info::isDiffractiveB()">
is either beam diffractively excited?
</methodmore>

<method name="bool Info::isMinBias()"> 
is the process a minimum-bias one?
</method>

<method name="bool Info::isLHA()"> 
has the process been generated from external Les Houches Accord 
information?
</method>

<method name="bool Info::atEndOfFile()"> 
true if a linked Les Houches class refuses to return any further 
events, presumably because it has reached the end of the file from 
which events have been read in.
</method>

<method name="bool Info::hasSub()"> 
does the process have a subprocess classification?
Currently only true for minbias and Les Houches events, where it allows 
the hardest collision to be identified. 
</method>

<method name="string Info::nameSub()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="int Info::codeSub()">
</methodmore>
<methodmore name="int Info::nFinalSub()">
the name, code and number of final-state partons in the subprocess
that occured when <code>hasSub()</code> is true. For a minimum-bias event 
the <code>code</code> would always be 101, while <code>codeSub()</code> 
would vary depending on the actual hardest interaction, e.g. 111 for 
<ei>g g -> g g</ei>. For a Les Houches event the <code>code</code> would 
always be 9999, while <code>codeSub()</code> would be the external 
user-defined classification code. The methods below would also provide 
information for such particular subcollisions.  
</methodmore>

partons; could be used e.g. for reweighting purposes. 
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::QFac()">

</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::phiHat()">

a <ei>2 -> 2</ei> process.
</methodmore>

<h3>Event weight and activity</h3>

<method name="double Info::weight()"> 
weight assigned to the current event. Is normally 1 and thus 
uninteresting. However, there are several cases where one may have
nontrivial event weights. These weights must the be used e.g. when 
filling histograms. 
<br/>(i) In the <code><aloc href="PhaseSpaceCuts">
PhaseSpace:increaseMaximum = off</aloc></code> default strategy,
an event with a differential cross-section above the assumed one 
(in a given phase-space point) is assigned a weight correspondingly
above unity. This should happen only very rarely, if at all, and so
could normally be disregarded. 
<br/>(ii) The <aloc href="UserHooks">User Hooks</aloc> class offers 
the possibility to bias the selection of phase space points, which 
means that events come with a compensating weight, stored here. 
<br/>(iii) For Les Houches events some strategies allow negative weights, 
which then after unweighting lead to events with weight -1. There are 
also Les Houches strategies where no unweighting is done, so events 
come with a weight. Specifically, for strategies <ei>+4</ei> and
<ei>-4</ei>, the event weight is in units of pb. (Internally in mb, 
but converted at output.) 
</method>

<method name="double Info::weightSum()"> 
Sum of weights accumulated during the run. For unweighted events this
agrees with the number of generated events. In order to obtain 
histograms normalized "per event", at the end of a run, histogram
contents should be divided by this weight. (And additionally 
divided by the bin width.) Normalization to cross section also
required multiplication by <code>sigmaGen()</code> below.
</method>

<method name="int Info::lhaStrategy()"> 
normally 0, but if Les Houches events are input then it gives the 
event weighting strategy, see 
<aloc href="LesHouchesAccord">Les Houches Accord</aloc>.
</method>

<method name="int Info::nISR()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="int Info::nFSRinProc()">
</methodmore>
<methodmore name="int Info::nFSRinRes()">
the number of emissions in the initial-state showering, in the final-state
showering excluding resonance decys, and in the final-state showering
inside resonance decays, respectively.
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::pTmaxMPI()"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::pTmaxISR()">
</methodmore>
<methodmore name="double Info::pTmaxFSR()">
Maximum <ei>pT</ei> scales set for MPI, ISR and FSR, given the 
process type and scale choice for the hard interactions. The actual
evolution will run down from these scales.
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::pTnow()">
The current <ei>pT</ei> scale in the combined MPI, ISR and FSR evolution.
Useful for classification in <aloc href="UserHooks">user hooks</aloc>,
but not once the event has been evolved.  
</method>

<method name="double Info::mergingWeight()"> 
combined CKKW-L weight assigned to the current event. If CKKW-L merging is 
performed, all histograms should be filled with this weight, as discussed in 
 <a href="MatrixElementMerging.html" target="page"> Matrix Element
Merging</a>.
</method>

<h3>Multiparton interactions</h3>

<method name="double Info::a0MPI()">
The value of a0 when an x-dependent matter profile is used,
<code>MultipartonInteractions:bProfile = 4</code>.
</method>

<method name="double Info::bMPI()"> 
The impact parameter <ei>b</ei> assumed for the current collision when
multiparton interactions are simulated. Is not expressed in any physical
size (like fm), but only rescaled so that the average should be unity 
for minimum-bias events (meaning less than that for events with hard
processes). 
</method>

<method name="double Info::enhanceMPI()"> 
The choice of impact parameter implies an enhancement or depletion of
the rate of subsequent interactions, as given by this number. Again
the average is normalized be unity for minimum-bias events (meaning 
more than that for events with hard processes).  
</method>

<method name="int Info::nMPI()"> 
The number of hard interactions in the current event. Is 0 for elastic
and diffractive events, and else at least 1, with more possible from
multiparton interactions.
</method>

<method name="int Info::codeMPI(int i)"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::pTMPI(int i)">
the process code and transverse momentum of the <code>i</code>'th 
subprocess, with <code>i</code> in the range from 0 to
<code>nMPI() - 1</code>. The values for subprocess 0 is redundant with
information already provided above.  
</methodmore>

<method name="int Info::iAMPI(i)"> 
</method>
<methodmore name="int Info::iBMPI(i)">
are normally zero. However, if the <code>i</code>'th subprocess is
a rescattering, i.e. either or both incoming partons come from the 
outgoing state of previous scatterings, they give the position in the
event record of the outgoing-state parton that rescatters. 
<code>iAMPI</code> and <code>iBMPI</code> then denote partons coming from 
the first or second beam, respectively.
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::eMPI(i)"> 
The enhancement or depletion of the rate of the <code>i</code>'th 
subprocess. Is primarily of interest for the 
<code>MultipartonInteractions:bProfile = 4</code> option, where the 
size of the proton depends on the <ei>x</ei> values of the colliding
partons. Note that <code>eMPI(0) = enhanceMPI()</code>.
</method>

<h3>Cross sections</h3>

Here are the currently available methods related to the event sample 
as a whole. While continuously updated during the run, it is recommended
only to study these properties at the end of the event generation, 
when the full statistics is available.

<method name="long Info::nTried()">
</method>
<methodmore name="long Info::nSelected()">
</methodmore>
<methodmore name="long Info::nAccepted()">
the total number of tried phase-space points, selected hard processes
and finally accepted events, summed over all allowed subprocesses.
The first number is only intended for a study of the phase-space selection
efficiency. The last two numbers usually only disagree if the user introduces 
some veto during the event-generation process; then the former is the number 
of acceptable events found by PYTHIA and the latter the number that also
were approved by the user. If you set <aloc href="ASecondHardProcess">a 
second hard process</aloc> there may also be a mismatch. 
</methodmore>

<method name="double Info::sigmaGen()">
</method>
<methodmore name="double Info::sigmaErr()">
the estimated cross section and its estimated error,
summed over all allowed subprocesses, in units of mb. The numbers refer to
the accepted event sample above, i.e. after any user veto. 
</methodmore>

<h3>Loop counters</h3>

Mainly for internal/debug purposes, a number of loop counters from
various parts of the program are stored in the <code>Info</code> class,
so that one can keep track of how the event generation is progressing.
This may be especially useful in the context of the  
<code><aloc href="UserHooks">User Hooks</aloc></code> facility.

<method name="int Info::getCounter(int i)">
the method that gives you access to the value of the various loop 
counters.
<argument name="i"> the counter number you want to access:

process has been completed successfully.

<h2>Jet Finders</h2>

<code>Pythia</code> comes with three <aloc href="EventAnalysis">built-in 
jet finders</aloc>, <code>ClusterJet</code> for <ei>e^+e^-</ei> events 
and <code>SlowJet</code> and <code>CellJet</code>for hadron collider ones. 
Especially the latter is not so well matched to the standards of its field, 
however. (But it is closely related to the anti-<ei>kT</ei> algorithm,
so is also not completely disconnected <ref>Cac08</ref>.)  
<code>SlowJet</code> can do jet finding according to the current-day 
<ei>kT</ei>, Cambridge/Aachen and anti-<ei>kT</ei> algorithms but,
as the name indicates, is is rather slow, especially when compared with 
the <code>FastJet</code> alternative.

<h3>FastJet</h3>

For realistic jet studies the <code>FastJet</code> package
<ref>Cac06</ref> has become a standard. Several different
jet options are available, such as <ei>kT</ei>,
Cambridge/Aachen, anti-<ei>kT</ei> and SISCone.

<p/>
Linking to <code>FastJet</code> is foreseen in the configure 
file in the <code>examples</code> subdirectory, and the 
<code>main71.cc</code> and <code>main72.cc</code> programs contain
examples how it can be used with <code>Pythia</code> events.

<p/>
The latter program makes use of the <code>include/FastJet3.h</code>
header file, contributed by Gavin Salam. This allows simple input 
of a <code>Pythia</code> particle into a <code>FastJet</code> one, 
either retaining only the four-momentum or the full particle information. 
Thereby more sophisticated selectors become possible at the 
<code>FastJet</code> level.

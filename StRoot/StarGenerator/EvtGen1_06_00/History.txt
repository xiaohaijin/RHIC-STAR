1st June 2016 John Back
    New tag incorporating all changes below. Recommended external packages
    are HepMC 2.06.09, pythia 8.186, Photos++ 3.61 and Tauola++ 1.1.5.

28th April 2016 Michal Kreps
    For Ds+ --> 2pi+ pi- there was double counting of branching fraction
    resulting in total branching fraction being 1.5 times larger than measured
    one. Fix by revisiting submodes, which now fill total Ds --> 3pi.

25th April 2016 Michal Kreps
    Added DECAY.DEC/XML, which contain updated semileptonic charm and beauty 
    branching fractions using the 2014 PDG, tuned to minimize disagreements 
    between measurements and EvtGen for both inclusive and exclusive decays. 
    Updated the evt.pdl particle properties file to the PDG 2014 edition.

    Implemented new LQCD form factors for Lb --> L mu mu from arXiv paper 
    1602.01399 (EvtRareLbToLllFFlQCD); old LQCD form factors are removed.

18th March 2016 John Back
    Fixed incorrect spinor algebra used in S1 -> 1/2 S2, 1/2 -> S3 S4 decays
    in EvtDiracParticle::rotateToHelicityBasis() functions, courtesy of
    Luis Miguel Garcia Martin and the IFIC Valencia LHCb group.

19th Feburary 2016 John Back
    Fixed bug in the definition of the initial spinor term Sinit in 
    EvtRareLbToLll::HadronicAmpRS(), from Tom Blake (LHCb).

12th February 2016 John Back
    From LHCb, added extensions to the EvtHQET2(FF) model for semitauonic
    decays from Brian Hamilton, which needs a patch to EvtSemiLeptonicAmp 
    from Jack Wimberley to ensure that the q^2 range is physical when 
    finding the maximum amplitude probability.

2nd December 2015 John Back
    From LHCb, added EvtKStopizmumu model for KS -> pi0 mu mu decays based on
    JHEP08(1998)004, courtesy of Veronika Chobanova, Diego Martinez Santos
    and Jeremy Dalseno. Added EvtConst::Fermi for Fermi coupling constant.

R01-05-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
21st October 2015 John Back
    New tag incorporating all changes below. Recommended external packages
    are HepMC 2.06.09, pythia 8.186, Photos++ 3.61 and Tauola++ 1.1.5.

    Added the EvtB2MuMuMuNu model for simulating the very rare four-leptonic 
    decays B- -> mu+ mu- anti-nu_mu mu-, courtesy Nikolai Nikitin.

16th October 2015 John Back
    Updated the configure script to automatically select the library names
    for PHOTOS++; version 3.56 and below uses Fortran, version 3.61 and above
    uses C++ only (default). Avoid using v3.60, since it does not work.
    This needs the PHOTOS libraries built before EvtGen is configured.
    Modified setupEvtGen.sh to use Photos++ v3.61.

7th October 2015 John Back
    Updated EvtGenExternal/EvtPhotosEngine to check that additional particles
    from the outgoing vertex are indeed (FSR) photons, since later versions of 
    PHOTOS introduce pair emission, where particles may not always be photons.

    Added the genRootDecayChain.cc validation program to create ROOT files 
    containing information about the complete decay tree. Two example test
    decay files BKstarGamma.dec and BuDst0rhop.dec can be used with this; the
    first tests PHOTOS, the second looks at sequential decay chain storage.
    The plotBKstarGamma.C ROOT macro can be used for B -> K* gamma plots.

2nd October 2015 John Back    
    Modified EvtSVPHelAmp and added a new EvtSVPHelCPMix model, implementing 
    the complete mixing phenomenology of Bs to vector gamma decays, courtesy 
    of Clara Remon (LHCb).

    EvtD0mixDalitz code: cleanup, inverted q/p for decays of D0bar (simplifies
    user decay files) and fixed y parameter bug, courtesy of Jordi Tico (LHCb).

    Changed the initialisation order of the infrared cut-off in EvtPhotosEngine.
    This actually has no effect, since the exponentiation function sets it to the
    same 1e-7 value, but it's now in the correct order if we need to update it.

    Removed all remaining obsolete pragma (Win32) warnings from some classes.

23rd September 2015 Michal Kreps
    Reimplement the real Spence function in C++ and removed its fortran
    implementation.

15th September 2015 Michal Kreps
    Fixed accessed uninitialised memory in EvtPDL.cpp, line 213.
    Modified the configure and setupEvtGen.sh scripts to work on Mac; needed
    Mac compilation patch files added to the new "platform" subdirectory. 

10th September 2015 John Back
    Updated setupEvtGen.sh to use the recommended external packages:
    HepMC 2.06.09, pythia 8.186, Photos++ 3.56 and Tauola++ 1.1.5. 

    Fixed form-factor calculations for the BTOSLLBALL model 6 used to generate
    b -> sll decays, courtesy of Christoph Langenbruch and David Loh (LHCb). 
    Affects B->K*ll, B->rholl and B->omegall, particularly the electron modes.

    In the validation directory, added runPhotosTest.sh for testing FSR in
    Upsilon(4S) -> e+ e- decays, and changed the plot comparison scripts to
    use the 2nd directory "oldRootFiles" (which could be a soft-link) for 
    including ROOT histograms made from a previous version of EvtGen.    

27th August 2015 John Back
    Added Mersenne-Twister random number generator (RNG) EvtMTRandomEngine.
    It requires c++11 compiler features (>= gcc 4.7), which should 
    automatically be enabled by the configure script. Introduced the 
    preprocessor environment variable EVTGEN_CPP11 for c++11 features.
    EvtMTRandomEngine is the default RNG for the validation and test examples
    if c++11 features are enabled.

    Added a phase-space test validation/genPHSP.sh and PhaseSpacePlots.C to
    visually check the flatness of Dalitz plots in order to ensure that the
    RNG is not producing biased results that depend on particle ordering.

    Added the models EvtbsToLLLLAmp and EvtbsToLLLLHyperCP for 
    B0_q -> l+ l- l+ l- decays (SM and one supersymmetric scenario), 
    courtesy of Nikolai Nikitin and Konstantin Toms. Documentation provided
    in doc/evt_BQTOLLLL_model.pdf and doc/evt_BQTOLLLLHYPERCP_model.pdf.

    Changed the installation and set-up script name to be just setupEvtGen.sh;
    it uses the VERSION variable to specify the required tag. List of tags
    are available using either "svn ls -v http://svn.cern.ch/guest/evtgen/tags"
    or by going to http://svn.cern.ch/guest/evtgen/tags in a web browser.

12th June 2015 John Back
    Changed the width of chi_b1 in evt.pdl from 9.8928 GeV (!) to zero.

1st May 2015 John Back
    Added Bc -> scalar ell nu (EvtBcSMuNu) and Bc -> tensor ell nu 
    (EvtBcTMuNu) decays, courtesy of Jack Wimberley, LHCb. Also included the 
    chi_c1 mode for EvtBcVMuNu.   

R01-04-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd April 2015 John Back
    Removed the EvtStdlibRandomEngine class since this can produce biases
    to kinematic distributions when one or more of the daughters is a 
    resonance, such as B0 -> K pi psi (thanks to Antonio Augusto Alves Jr 
    who discovered this issue). EvtSimpleRandomEngine is now the default 
    random number generator in the validation and test examples.

    Incorporated several additions and modifications from LHCb:
    a) From Michal Kreps, Tom Blake & Christoph Langenbruch,
       added rare Lb --> Lambda^(*) ell ell models described in
       arXiv:1108.6129, with various form factors from Gutsche et al. 
       (arXiv:1301.3737) and lattice QCD  (arXiv:1212.4827)
    b) From Andrew Crocombe, implemented Bs --> K* form factors 
       from Ball-Zwicky and z-parametrization form factors from 
       arXiv:1006.4945 for EvtbTosllBallFF
    c) Christoph Langenbruch fixed the Bs -> phi ll form factors in
       EvtbTosllBallFF; T3 showed a non-physical pole at very low 
       q2 which significantly affected the electron mode
    d) From Michal Kreps, removed semicolons from wrong places to
       clear warnings when compiled with the "-pedantic" option.

9th October 2014 John Back
    Change svnweb.cern.ch to svn.cern.ch in the setup script.

1st April 2014 John Back
     In EvtReport, modified the logging output severity status flags
     to have the "EVTGEN_" prefix, e.g. INFO becomes EVTGEN_INFO. 
     The global report() function has been renamed to EvtGenReport().

31st March 2014 John Back
     Added the ability to store named attributes for EvtParticles in the
     form of a map<string, int>. The setAttribute(name, value) stores the
     required value, while getAttribute(name) retrieves the integer value.
     This is used in EvtPhotosEngine to specify the final-state radiation
     "FSR" attribute to 1 for any additional photons (EvtPhotonParticles)
     created by Photos++. It also stores the "ISR" attribute, but this 
     is always set to zero, since only FSR photons are created.
     If the named attribute doesn't exist, then getAttribute() returns zero.

29th January 2014 Daniel Craik
     Removed mass assertion on GS shape in EvtDalitzReso to allow it to also 
     be used for charged rho resonances.

27th January 2014 John Back
     Minor corrections to Vub models to remove further gcc 4.8 warnings.
     Updated configure script to work for MacOS clang (from Genser team).

R01-03-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
9th January 2014 John Back
     New tag version "1.3.0", incorporating all changes below.

     Replaced auto-install script to work with this version as well as
     the latest versions of all external generator packages.
     Updated README to mention the new CERN-based web pages for Photos++ 
     and Tauola++.

8th January 2014 John Back
     Fix gcc 4.6 and 4.8 compilation warnings, courtesy of 
     Patrick Robbe (LHCb); main changes are removal of unused variables.
     Changed the EvtPythiaEngine class and configure script to use new 
     Pythia 8 header locations; Pythia 8.180 or above is now required.

7th January 2014 John Back
     Modified EvtBCVFF to correct the Kiselev form factors from 
     Jack Wimberley (LHCb).

9th October 2013 Daniel Craik
     Added Gounaris-Sakurai and Gaussian shapes to EvtGenericDalitz 
     and set sensible defaults for LASS parameters.

19th September 2013 John Back
     Modified EvtGenExternal/EvtPythiaEngine to keep track of any new 
     particles that are added to the default Pythia database to avoid
     duplicating particle/anti-particle entries that could override
     previously defined Pythia decay chains.

18th September 2013 John Back
     Added Mac OS flags for the configure script and src/Makefile.

15th July 2013 Daniel Craik
     Added flag to turn on scaling of LASS amplitude by M/q in EvtDalitzReso

15th July 2013 Daniel Craik
     EvtParserXML now accepts file names containing environment variables,
     exponential non-resonant shape in EvtDalitzReso now defined as exp(-alpha*m^2),
     LASS shape in EvtDalitzReso now takes a cutoff parameter

4th July 2013 Daniel Craik
     Added LASS, exponential non-resonant and linear non-resonant shapes to EvtGenericDalitz.

3rd July 2013 Daniel Craik
     Fixed auto-install script for R01-02-00.

1st July 2013 Daniel Craik
     Added auto-install script for R01-02-00.

R01-02-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
15th May 2013 John Back
     New tag, version "1.2.0", incorporating all changes below.

14th May 2013 Michal Kreps
     Added Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factors up to L=5 in 
     EvtGenBase/EvtBlattWeisskopf::compute().

14th May 2013 John Back
     Added additional entries (appended at the end) to the evt.pdl particle 
     data file courtesy of Romulus Godang and Belle II colleagues.

14th March 2013 John Back
     Added the method EvtParticle::getPDGId() to get the PDG integer for a
     particle directly (which just calls EvtPDL::getStdHep()).
     Added a check in EvtPhotosEngine::doDecay to skip Photos if a given 
     particle has too many daughters (>= 10) to avoid a problem with a 
     hard coded upper limit in the Photos PHOENE subroutine.

2nd February 2013 Daniel Craik
     Updated EvtDalitzTable to estimate probMax when it is missing from a 
     Dalitz model.

1st  February 2013 John Back
     Added the ability to read in Pythia 6 commands in ascii decay files in
     EvtDecayTable::readDecayFile (this was already possible in xml files).
     Modified the Photos++ engine default settings to be more suited to B
     decays (from LHCb defaults).

31st January 2013 John Back
     Added the ability to read in Pythia 8 commands in ascii decay files
     in EvtDecayTable::readDecayFile. They can be set using the syntax:
     "PythiaTypeParam module:variable=value", where Type = Generic, Alias or
     Both for specifying whether the parameter is for the generic or alias
     Pythia decay engines (or both). The 2nd argument must not contain any
     spaces. Fixed the list of commands strings being used in the 
     EvtPythiaEngine class (i.e. Pythia parameters that can be set via decay
     files).

31st January 2013 Daniel Craik
     Added named parameters to various decay models.

30th January 2013 John Back
     Fixed some of the parameter arguments used in the EvtSVSCPiso model.

24th January 2013 John Back
     Set the Photos++ and Tauola++ models to use the EvtGen random number 
     engine when useEvtGenRandom is set to true in the EvtExternalGenList 
     constructor.

23rd January 2013 John Back
     Added EvtGenExternal/EvtPythiaRandom to allow the use of the EvtGen
     random number engine to also be used for the random engine for Pythia 8.
     Added a boolean (useEvtGenRandom, default = true) within the 
     EvtExternalGenList constructor to use this feature.

18th December 2012 John Back
     Corrected some wrong daughter ordering assignments for decay modes 5 and
     12 in EvtDDalitz. Updated validation/DalitzDecays.xml to also contain
     D decay mode 12, as well as various modes that may use K_S0 and K_L0. 
     Added validation/genDDalitzModes.sh and updated 
     validation/compareDalitz.C to do a complete comparison of the D Dalitz 
     modes with the xml versions.

11th December 2012 Daniel Craik
     Updated the Xml parser to support named model parameters. Updated the 
     generic Dalitz model to use named model parameters as an example.

15th October 2012 John Back
     Make EvtSimpleRandomEngine inherit from EvtRandomEngine to avoid
     crash in EvtGen.cpp when no random engine is defined 
     (from Bjoern Spruck).

R01-01-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
4th October 2012 John Back
     New tag, version "1.1.0", incorporating all changes below.

     Provide proper default constructors for EvtVector4R and 
     EvtPhotonParticle. Modified the validation and test code to also
     compile/link in the case of no external generators being included.

3rd October 2012 John Back
     Corrected the t3 vector form factor values for the Ball-Zwicky '05 
     model (modelId = 6) in EvtbTosllBallFF::getVectorFF(), which
     were set to t3tilde instead.

18th September 2012 John Back
     Moved the external generator engines to a new sub-directory 
     EvtGenExternal. Building the code now creates 2 libraries:
     libEvtGen.so (Base+Models) and libEvtGenExternal.so.
     This allows anyone to ignore using the new external generators
     if required (by not creating/loading the 2nd library).

     Added prefix option to the configure script/Makefile to allow the user 
     to specify an installation directory for the include files, libraries, 
     DECAY.DEC and evt.pdl files (for Genser).

14th September 2012 Michal Kreps
     Fixed the calculation of the angle between decay planes in the function
     EvtKine::EvtDecayAngleChi. Fixed typo in EvtLb2Lll decay model. Only 
     some NP scenarious could be affected, SM one is definitely unaffected.

13th September 2012 John Back
     Added the use of the environment variables EVTGEN_PHOTOS, EVTGEN_PYTHIA 
     and EVTGEN_TAUOLA to specify if the Photos, Pythia and/or Tauola engine
     classes are used or not. These variables are set by the configure script,
     depending if the library paths are specified for these generators.

R01-00-01--------------------------------------------------------------------
12th September 2012 John Back
     New tag incorporating all changes below, since R01-00-00.

11th September 2012 John Back
     Modified the Photos and Tauola engine classes to use the new
     Photospp and Tauolapp namespaces that are present in the latest
     versions of Photos++(3.5) and Tauola++(1.0.7). Updated the configure file 
     to get the correct location of the Tauola++ include files. 

     Added the D0->pi+pi-pi0 decay mode in EvtDDalitz from Marco Gersabeck 
     and Frederic Dreyer (LHCb).

     Added new decay models/classes from Alexey Luchinsky (LHCb):
     EvtBcVMuNu, EvtTVP, EvtWnPi, EvtSVP, EvtXPsiGamma, EvtBcVNpi

29th June 2012 John Back
     Corrected mass(squared) variables filled in the Dalitz TTree in 
     validation/genExampleRootFiles.

15th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Updated EvtD0gammaDalitz to deal with D mesons from neutral B->DK
     Added save function to validation/compareDalitz.C.

11th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Replaced BaBar specific configuration for BlattWeisskopf birth factors.
     Updated XML conversion script to handle new configuration.
     Fixed some bugs in the XML conversion script related to particle 
     modifications.

9th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added latex documentation for xml decay files.

2nd May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added resDaughters attribute to the Dalitz resonance xml tag to 
     simplify defining symmetric resonances. Updated validation xml files to 
     use the new functionality.

27th April 2012 Daniel Craik
     Upgraded EvtGenericDalitz to use EvtDalitzReso for resonances.
     Added validation to compare EvtGenericDalitz to all 11 EvtDDalitz modes.
     Added a root macro to quickly compare two Dalitz decays for validation.

24th April 2012 John Back
     Solved two bugs in the EvtD0gammaDalitz model (from Jordi Tico, LHCb):
     configuration of the conjugated model, and using only the B charge
     to determine the model used, not the D flavour.

17th April 2012 Daniel Craik
     Updated the GenericDalitz validation code to use the same probMax 
     values as DDalitz. Added XML decay file parsing to EvtGen::readUDecay.
     Dec files are still the default.

30th March 2012 John Back
     Update maximum probability values in EvtDDalitz::initProbMax()
     for all DDalitz modes.

23rd March 2012 John Back
     Added the EvtEta2MuMuGamma decay model from LHCb.

21st March 2012 John Back
     Added EvtD0gammaDalitz decay model from LHCb.

20th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added backwards compatibility for Pythia 6 commands in the XML 
     configuration. Updated decay file conversion tool to convert JetSetPar 
     lines to pythia6Param tags.

19th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added infrastructure to pass commands to external generators.
     XML config now takes Pythia8 configuration commands.

16th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added the ability to define particles from the PDL for Dalitz decay 
     resonances instead of defining mass, width and spin seperately. Renamed 
     the lifetime attribute of Dalitz decay resonaces to width to avoid 
     confusion. Added further validation code for the generic Dalitz model.

15th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added validation code for xml decay files and the generic Dalitz model. 

R01-00-00 ------------------------------------------------------------------
6th March 2012 John Back
    First official version for Genser (evtgen 1.0.0) that includes
    support for external generators: Pythia8, Photos++ and Tauola++. 
    This also includes a preliminary version of creating Dalitz plot
    decay models using EvtGenericDalitz.

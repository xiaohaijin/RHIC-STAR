 Brief "How-To" compile and use standalone version of the StDbLib:

 1. cvs co StRoot/StDbLib;
 2. cd StRoot/StDbLib; make;
 3. cd StRoot/StDbLib/examples/fgt; make;
 4. $> ./read_table_fgt 

 NOTE: by default, DB API will connect to offline db pool. If you want to use it in online domain, please 
 place dbServers.xml file to your home directory, so it will override default settings.

 If you have more questions, please contact STAR DB Administrator ( "Dmitry Arkhipkin" <arkhipkin@bnl.gov> )

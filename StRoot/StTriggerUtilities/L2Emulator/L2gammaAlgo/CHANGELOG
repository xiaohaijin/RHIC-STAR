1. eemcConstants.h and bemcConstants.h to contain geometric constants
   specifying the construction of the endcap and barrel. 
2. jbook() called only once.  jclear() called during initRun resets all
   histograms.  
3. remove nested structures from L2gammaResult2006 and elevate version #,
   and any reference to the nested structures in L2gammaAlgo.cxx.  this is
   to prevent a "helpful" compiler from padding the elements in the 
   L2result array. 
4. error generated in initRun() if I_par[0] != 0 or 1. 
5. the "L2 preprocessor" option now must be enabled by a compile time 
   switch,  OPT_PREPROCESS.  Improves speed if running a single threshold. 
6. MAX_TOWERS=4800 defined in header file.  b/eemcConstants.h moved from
   L2gammaAlgo.h to .cxx.  
7. cleanup of L2gammaResult2006.h (old "crap" deleted).
8.

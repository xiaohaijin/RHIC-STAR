Setup for L2 simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All is still in mess.

1)
May  be disabled in the main macro by the switch:
 int useL2=1, // 0== off

2)
Thresholds & setup  of L2-algos are hardcoded in the maker, only one set. Will switch to external files soon.

3) Need input directory with the following setup files
>ls  L2setup-20060410 
btowCrateMask.current  btowDb.current  etowCrateMask.current  etowDb.current  pedestal.current  towerMask.current

Those are real files used by L2 during the run. The directory name reflects date of the run. We have not changed this setup too often.

For M-C you use for now the same setup, just clone it.

4) needs output directory:
 L2out-20060410
to store all output L2-histos in _customary_ format. One file per L2-algo.
Run   binH2rootH program to convert them to regular histograms.


5) StL2TriggerSimu provides light interface between L2Maker and L0maker, it has just 2 methods:
StL2TriggerSimu::Init() connects to L2-maker
StL2TriggerSimu::isTrigger(int trigId) querries L2maker for given triggerID

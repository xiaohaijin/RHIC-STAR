Setup of EEmc L0 trigger emulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0) STAR-DB is needed to re-map ADC from muDst in to 


1) enable switch in the main macro:
   int useEemc=1, // 0== off
2) you need to have directory:
>ls L0setup/EemcFeePed/
03.07.2006  04.06.2006  04.28.2006
>ls L0setup/EemcFeePed/03.07.2006/
crate1board1.ped4  crate2board2.ped4  crate3board3.ped4  crate4board4.ped4  ...
with FEE ped4 pedestals if you run on real data from 2006. For other years it will crash.

3) for M-C you must specify DB-time stamp
   dbMk->SetDateTime(20070101,1 );
to be in year 2007. This will automatically assure ideal FEE ped4 values are generated by the code itself.

4) for real data from 2006 all relevant DSM thresholds and switches are hardcoded. You may overwrite them with any values be calling:
 int eemcDsmSetup[20]; 
 eemcDsmSetup[0]=3;  // HTthr0
....
 simuTrig->eemc->setDsmSetup(eemcDsmSetup);    
Note, _all_ values must be consistent with each other, or you will get wired/wrong results.

5) one can control amount of computation by configuring:
simuTrig->useEemc(0); // process only ADC data
simuTrig->useEemc(1); // process  ADC & trigger data , not for M-C
simuTrig->useEemc(2); // as above, additionaly compare event by event both results and fill QA histos


6) output histos are saved in hist.root file with the core name as the run # in the directory out2/

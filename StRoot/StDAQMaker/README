Package: StDAQMaker
Responsible: Victor Perevoztchikov (perev@bnl.gov)

Purpose: Maker to read DAQ data.

1) Inherited from StIOInterface class
 
2) Wrapper for numerous DAQ Reader classes. 

3) Hides from user houskeeping of DAQ classes: 
   a) openenig/closing of files;
   b) selection or skipping of the events
   c) instantiation and deletion of needed DAQ readers and
      central modification/improvement of policy of how and what
      to keep and what and when to delete;
   etc...

4) provides via StDAQReader, StTPCReader ...  classes interface for
   other makers to get DAQ data
   
5) Breaks dependency from DAQ classes, which could be modified without
   touching user maker code. Only StDAQMaker must be modified to coop
   with changes in DAQ classes

<h1>StHFillObject></h1>

<pre>
Inheritance from this class allows simple manipulations of collections
of these objects for histogramming and printing values from the derived
class using the Print() and Draw() member functions. This ease-of-use
is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that calling the Draw() or
Print() member functions of a collection automatically loop through the
collection calling the Print() and Draw() member functions of the individual
objects (such objects must inherit from TObject, as StHFillObject does).

The Print() and Draw() member functions work for individual instances too.
For example, with a pointer to an instance of the derived class (dPtr), one
can see the values of any member function or data member:

   (if alpha() is a member function, i.e. dPtr->alpha();)
   dPtr->Print("alpha");
   dPtr->Print("alpha()");

   (if alpha() takes arguments)
   dPtr->Print("alpha(3.5,2.1)");

One can specify multiple members, or even use formulas:
(Spaces are generally ignored)

   (if beta is a public data member, i.e. dPtr->beta;)
   dPtr->Print("alpha:beta");
   dPtr->Print("alpha+beta : 8*(alpha-beta)");

Members which return pointers to float arrays are also supported:

   (if gamma is a member function which returns float*)
   dPtr->Print("alpha:gamma[0]");
   dPtr->Print(" gamma()[8] : gamma[7] : gamma[0]+ gamma()[2]");

For multiple sets of numbers, use a semicolon (";") or return ("\n")
to separate sets. With Print(), multiple sets make multiple lines of output
with a number in the first column indicating the set on that line.
(A set with only spaces will cause an error.)

   dPtr->Print("alpha:beta;alpha+beta:alpha - beta");

Curly brackets around a particular formula indicate that it is to be used
as a selection cut (print only if this value is non-zero, boolean expressions
evaluate to 1 or 0):

   dPtr->Print("alpha:beta:{alpha-beta}");

Histograms can be filled using the Draw() method. This is identical to
the Print() method except that the first portion of any set is the Root
name of the histogram:

   TH1F h1("hist1","This is a histogram",100,0.,100.);
   dPtr->Draw("hist1:alpha");
   TH2F h2("hist2","This is a 2-D histogram",100,0.,100.,10,-1.,1.);
   dPtr->Draw("hist1:alpha ; hist2:alpha:beta");

For histogramming, the number of colon-separated formulas following the
histogram name within a set must match the number of dimensions of the
histogram. Selection cuts can also be used, where a non-boolean expression
evaluates to the weight used in filling the histogram.

   dPtr->Draw("hist1:alpha:{beta>1}");

Thus, an entire collection (TCollection or derived class) of these objects
can be handled en masse:

   (if cPtr is a pointer to a collection of StHFillObject-derived objects)
   cPtr->Draw("hist1:alpha");
   cPtr->Print("beta:(alpha*3.6)-2.3");

Lastly, if the derived class has an Update() member function, then one can
call it through ls("Update"). This is useful if one wants to do some sort
of processing on an entire collection with one call, as ls() is implemented
for collections just as Draw() and Print():

   cPtr->ls("Update");

StPmdReadMaker
===========

	This Maker works as an interface between StDAQMaker (and StDaqLib) for PMD
   and outside world of PMD reconstruction.

   	It instantiates PMD reader from StDAQmaker and gets PMD data by using method
   from StPmdReader in StDAQmaker.
	The data are obtained in terms of secno,blockno,cram_no and channel no.

      In this routine we apply mapping on those data-coordinates (mapping code exist in 
   StPmdGeom in StPmdUtil) and then apply calibration constants from database to make the 
   data uniform.

   The PMD (and CPV) hits are then stored in StEvent container as StPhmdHit.

11th. March, 2004: The following changes have been made before AuAu200GeV production

	1. There is a switch based on the run number, which selects the proper VME crate 
	   condition i.e. whether only one or both the crates are working.

	2. The StPmdGeom reads a particular text file (xxxx_BoardDetail.txt) depending on
	   the run number to apply proper mapping. This is needed because the status
	   of the FEE boards changes(1 for present, 0 for absent) in course of time.

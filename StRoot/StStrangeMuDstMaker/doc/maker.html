<a name="code"><h2>The Code</h2></a>
The self-documented code can be viewed through doxygen <a
href="http://www.star.bnl.gov/webdatanfs/dox/html/classStStrangeMuDstMaker.html">
here</a>.

<p>
<HR width=60%>
<p>

<a name="content"><h2>Specifying Content for Micro-DSTs</h2></a>
After instantiating a StStrangeMuDstMaker, the user should tell
the maker which components they want to work with. No components
are turned on by default. Component content is controlled via
the <tt>Do*()</tt> member functions:
<ul>
<li><tt>DoV0()</tt>
<li><tt>DoXi()</tt>
<li><tt>DoKink()</tt>
<li><tt>DoMc()</tt>
</ul>
For example, calling the <tt>DoV0()</tt> member function will cause V0
components to be created/read for the micro-DST associated with this maker.
In read mode, the user need not turn on components they will not be using
even if they are on the micro-DST on file. Here is a brief example:
<pre>
  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeDst();
  strangeDst.DoV0();
</pre>
<p>

Note that <tt>DoMc()</tt> turns on processing of the Monte Carlo data
and association branches for each of the content types turned on by any
of the first three <tt>Do*()</tt> member functions.
<p>

<hr width=10% align=left>
<a name="creating"><h2>Creating Micro-DSTs</h2></a>
Create mode is the default mode for the StStrangeMuDstMaker maker.
The maker and supporting code libraries must be loaded, and the maker
should be used in a standard STAR chain which provides an StEvent structure
from which the micro-DST can be made. Currently, persistent StEvent is
not supported, so a standard DST should be read in, and StEventMaker should
be used to build the StEvent before the StStrangeMuDstMaker. The user
need not do anything during the event loop of the chain as the filling of
the micro-DST from StEvent is done automatically. A good
example is provided in the macro:<br>
<tt>$STAR/StRoot/macros/analysis/makeStrangeMuDst.C</tt>,<br>
where something like the following is used:
<pre>
  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeDst();
  strangeDst.DoV0();     // Selects V0 vertices for micro-DST
  strangeDst.DoXi();     // Selects Xi vertices for micro-DST
  strangeDst.DoMc();     // Selects MC info for both V0 and Xi for micro-DST
  strangeDst.SetWrite(); // Sets "write" mode (using default filenames)
</pre>

<h3>Creating on File</h3>
The above macro demonstrates creating a micro-DST from StEvent and saving
it to a file. Saving to file is specified with the <tt>SetWrite()</tt>
member function of the maker. This member function should be called after
the maker is instantiated, but before the <tt>Init()</tt> member function
of the chain is called. <tt>SetWrite()</tt> takes up to four paramters,
but only the first is important at present. These four parameters are
the filenames associated with the four component branches of the micro-DST
(described in the section on
<a href="microDST.html#structure">Structure of the Micro-DST</a>).
Each filename has a default, and not entering parameters leads to the
use of the default values. The root of the TTree itself is kept in the
<tt>Event</tt> component file, which defaults to "evMuDst.root".

<h3>Creating in Memory</h3>
This is the default creation mode for the maker. If no <tt>Set*()</tt>
member functions are called, a micro-DST is created, and stored in memory.
It is not written to file. It can be accessed via the maker's
<tt>GetTree()</tt> member function. See the <a href="#tools">Tools from
StStrangeMuDstMaker</a> section below. A word of caution: the amount of
memory that the micro-DST uses as it grows from event to event is
not limited. It is possible to use all the available memory on the
machine, leading to a crash and loss of data. This option is thus good
for relatively small micro-DSTs; larger ones should either be written
to disk (see Creating on File above), or erased after each event
(see Persistence in Memory below).

<h4>Persistence in Memory</h4>
When creating a micro-DST, it may be that the user does not want to retain
information from event to event. For example, the HBT maker might wish to
use the strangeness micro-DST and its interface, but might need it only on
an event-by-event basis. There is no need in this case to let the micro-DST
grow, consuming more and more memory as each event progresses. The
<tt>SetNoKeep()</tt> member function implements this functionality, causing
the micro-DST to be erased after each event. Usage is as follows:
<pre>
  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeDst();
  strangeDst.DoV0();
  strangeDst.SetNoKeep();
</pre>


<hr width=10% align=left>
<a name="reading"><h2>Reading Micro-DSTs</h2></a>
Read mode is set by using the <tt>SetRead()</tt> member function. As with
the other <tt>Set*()</tt> member functions, this should be called
between the instantiation of the maker and the <tt>Init()</tt> member
function of the chain. Also, as with the <tt>SetWrite()</tt> member function,
up to four parameters can be entered specifying the files on which the
micro-DST is located. The user should, in general, need only specify
one file: that of the event component branch, where the root of the
TTree used in the micro-DST resides. This file defaults to "evMuDst.root"
if no parameters are given to <tt>SetRead()</tt>.<p>

If the user is interested in reading in several micro-DSTs, the use of
the StFile class is employed. StFile can take as an argument in its
constructor an array of file names, any of which may also include wild
cards (as in <tt>"ev*Dst.root"</tt>). Passing <tt>SetRead()</tt> a pointer
to the StFile class then teaches StStrangeMuDstMaker what files to read.
Here is an example:
<pre>
  char* files[3];
  files[0] = "/bigfiles/run471.evMuDst.root";
  files[1] = "/bigfiles/run475.evMuDst.root";
  files[2] = "/oldfiles/run*.evMuDst.root";
  StFiles* flist = new StFile(files);
  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeDst();
  strangeDst.SetRead(flist);
</pre>
<p>

Access to the micro-DST is then available inside the event loop.
Member functions outlined in the section below on
<a href="#tools">Tools from StStrangeMuDstMaker</a> allow the user to
find out how many V0's, Xi's, or Kink's, as well as their respective
Monte Carlo counterparts, are in the given event and access individual
instances of the micro-DST component classes. The user can then loop over
all vertices from an event, and can call member functions from the
micro-DST component classes. A good example is provided in:<br>
<tt>$STAR/StRoot/macros/analysis/readStrangeMuDst.C</tt>,<br>
with an event loop looking something like this:
<pre>
  Int_t Nevents = 10;
  // Loop over events
  for( Int_t i=0; i &lt; Nevents; i++ ) {
    if( chain.Make(i) ) break;
    // Loop over V0 vertices
    for( Int_t j=0; j &lt; strangeDst.GetNV0(); j++ ) {
      StV0MuDst *v0m = strangeDst.GetV0(j);
      hist->Fill(v0m->massLambda());
    }
    if( i != Nevents) chain.Clear();
  }
  chain.Finish();
</pre>
<p>

Additionally, the user need not examine every event in the micro-DST.
If the user specifies an integer parameter in the <tt>Make()</tt> member
function call for the chain, then the event associated with that integer
is read from the micro-DST. For example, if the event loop runs from
<tt>i = 5...9</tt>, and the chain is run with <tt>chain.Make(i)</tt>,
then the 6th through 10th events on the file will be read in (the first
event on file is event zero). This allows the user to skip events or
read in only a portion of the events on the micro-DST. If no parameter is
given to <tt>Make()</tt>, the micro-DST file is read from the beginning.<p>

<h4>Monte Carlo Data</h4>
Monte Carlo data is accessed similarly using functions with "Mc" in their
names. Associations between Monte Carlo and reconstructed data can be
accessed via functions with "Assoc" in their names. Examining associated
vertices may look something like this:
<pre>
  Int_t Nevents = 10;
  // Loop over events
  for( Int_t i=0; i &lt; Nevents; i++ ) {
    if( chain.Make(i) ) break;
    // Loop over V0 vertices
    for( Int_t j=0; j &lt; strangeDst.GetNV0Assoc(); j++ ) {
      StStrangeAssoc* v0a = strangeDst.GetV0Assoc(j);
      StV0MuDst* v0m = strangeDst.GetV0(v0a->indexRecoArray());
      StV0Mc* v0mc = strangeDst.GetV0Mc(v0a->indexMcArray());
      hist->Fill(v0m->ptV0() - v0mc->ptV0());
    }
    if( i != Nevents) chain.Clear();
  }
  chain.Finish();
</pre>
<p>

Code can be written that works identically for reconstructed and Monte Carlo
data using the <tt>Get*I()</tt> functions and interface classes:
<pre>
  Bool_t MC = kTRUE; // kFALSE for reconstructed data
  Int_t Nevents = 10;
  // Loop over events
  for( Int_t i=0; i &lt; Nevents; i++ ) {
    if( chain.Make(i) ) break;
    // Loop over V0 vertices
    for( Int_t j=0; j &lt; strangeDst.GetNV0I(MC); j++ ) {
      StV0I *v0i = strangeDst.GetV0I(j,MC);
      hist->Fill(v0i->pseudoRapV0());
    }
    if( i != Nevents) chain.Clear();
  }
  chain.Finish();
</pre>
<p>

<hr width=10% align=left>
<a name="filtering"><h2>Filtering Micro-DSTs</h2></a>
There are certainly times when only a portion of a micro-DST is of interest
to a user. One then may wish to create a sub-micro-DST (or nano-DST) containing
only that portion which is of interest. This allows greater portability
for that portion of the micro-DST, and also improves access speed. To do
this, two makers are needed: one to create the new sub-micro-DST,
and one to read an already existing micro-DST. The maker for the new
data must be instantiated before the maker for the existing data.
After both have been instantiated, the maker for the new data must be told
that it will be a subset of the old - this is done via the <tt>SubDst()</tt>
member function, and should be implemented in the following style:
<pre>
  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeNewDst("strangeNewMuDst");
  strangeNewDst.DoV0();
  strangeNewDst.SetWrite("newEvMuDst.root");

  StStrangeMuDstMaker strangeOldDst("strangeOldMuDst");
  strangeOldDst.SetRead("oldEvMuDst.root");

  strangeNewDst.SubDst(strangeOldDst);
</pre>
The filenames used above are up to the user, and different combinations
of strangeness micro-DST components other than simply the V0 components
can be used. Note that <tt>DoV0()</tt> need not be called for the old
micro-DST maker, as the new one knows to at least try to make sure
that the reading of the V0's is turned on.<p>

If one is filtering the micro-DST, new or additional cuts are probably
also being used. If this is the case, one should consider adding cuts
information to the strangeness cuts list stored with the micro-DST.
More information on how to do this is available for
<a href="cuts.html">the cuts</a>.<p>

The selection process for what goes into the sub-micro-DST can be viewed
under two paradigms. The first paradigm encompasses a user who wants to
take only those vertices which satisfy some criteria, and the second
paradigm is for those who want to keep events which satisfy a criteria.
Both selection processes are done during the event loop, between the
<tt>Make()</tt> and <tt>Clear()</tt> member function calls of the chain.
The event for the old micro-DST is read in during <tt>Make()</tt>, selections
are made, and the new sub-micro-DST is written during <tt>Clear()</tt>.
Selections are made via the <tt>Select*()</tt> member functions:

<dl>
<dt>Vertex Selection Paradigm:
<dd>In this model, only certain vertices from within an event are selected
to go on the sub-micro-DST. The vertices are selected with the following
six member functions:
<ul>
<li><tt>SelectV0(j)</tt>
<li><tt>SelectXi(j)</tt>
<li><tt>SelectKink(j)</tt>
<li><tt>UnselectV0(j)</tt>
<li><tt>UnselectXi(j)</tt>
<li><tt>UnselectKink(j)</tt>
</ul>
In these calls, <tt>j</tt> specifies the index of the vertex within that
event to be selected. For example, one might like to select only those
cascades with a transverse momentum above 500 Mev/c. This would be done
in a loop as follows:
<pre>
  // Loop over events
  for( Int_t i=0; i &lt; Nevents; i++ ) {
    if( chain.Make(i) ) break;
    // Loop over Xi vertices
    for( Int_t j=0; j &lt; strangeOldDst.GetNXi(); j++ ) {
      StXiMuDst *xim = strangeDst.GetXi(j);
      if (xim->ptXi() > 0.5) strangeNewDst.SelectXi(j);
    }
    if( i != Nevents) chain.Clear();
  }
  chain.Finish();
</pre>
The user can also specify that all of a specific vertex type can be
selected for a particular event by setting the input parameter
<tt>j</tt> to be a negative number. Thus, <tt>SelectV0(-1)</tt> would
select all V0 candidates in the event, but would select no other vertex
types for copying.
<p>

Similarly, one can unselect a specific vertex that one has already selected
using the <tt>Unselect*()</tt> member functions. This is particularly useful
if there are only a few vertices one would not wish to select, in which case
one would use <tt>Select*(-1)</tt> followed by a few specific uses of
<tt>Unselect*(j)</tt>. Again, a negative input unselects the entire event.
<p>

One note of caution: <tt>Select*(j)</tt> does not check to see if a vertex
has already been selected, so selecting one twice results in two copies.
<p>

<dt>Event Selection Paradigm:
<dd>If one wishes to select events as a whole for a sub-micro-DST, this can
be done with the <tt>SelectEvent()</tt> member function. This essentially
copies the entire event from the old micro-DST to the new sub-micro-DST,
but is only true to the extent that what micro-DST components are turned
on for the new maker (via the <tt>Do*()</tt> member functions, see
<a href="#content">Specifying Content for Micro-DSTs</a>). Here is an
example where the user takes all events which have more than 10 Kinks:
<pre>
  // Loop over events
  for( Int_t i=0; i &lt; Nevents; i++ ) {
    if( chain.Make(i) ) break;
    if (strangeOldDst.GetNKink() > 10) strangeNewDst.SelectEvent();
    if( i != Nevents) chain.Clear();
  }
  chain.Finish();
</pre>
This is really the equivalent of using the vertex selection paradigm
with input parameter <tt>j = -1</tt> for all active components.
<p>
It is important to understand that an event which has not been selected
will still have its event branch data copied to the filtered micro-DST,
even if none of the secondary vertex data is copied.
UnselectEvent() will restore any event in which any selections have
already been made to this same state of copying the event branch only.
If you truly want to eliminate an event entirely from the filtered
micro-DST, then use AbortEvent(). Here is an example:
<pre>
    StStrangeEvMuDst* ev = strageOlDst.GetEvent();
    if (fabs(ev->primaryVertexZ())<100.) {
      strangeNewDst.SelectEvent();
    } else {
      strangeNewDst.AbortEvent();
    }
</pre>
</dl>

Both paradigms are shown in the following macro, with the vertex selection
paradigm scheme run by default, and an event selection example commented
out:<br>
<tt>$STAR/StRoot/macros/analysis/filterStrangeMuDst.C</tt>.<p>


<hr width=10% align=left>
<a name="tools"><h2>Tools from StStrangeMuDstMaker</h2></a>

<ul>
<li>Getting a particular event from file:
<br><tt>chain.Make(i)</tt>
<br>- Use the input parameter <tt>i</tt> of <tt>Make()</tt> to specify the
index of the event read in (event indices start at zero). This is useful
only in the read mode (see <a href="#reading">Reading Micro-DSTs</a>)<p>

<li>Getting the number of vertices for an event:
<br><tt>Int_t GetNV0()</tt>
<br><tt>Int_t GetNXi()</tt>
<br><tt>Int_t GetNKink()</tt>
<br>- Returns an integer with the number of that particular vertex type.
<br>- Append "Mc" or "Assoc" to the function name for Monte Carlo vertices
or associations between MC and reconstructed data.<p>

<li>Getting a pointer to a particular vertex:
<br><tt>StV0MuDst* GetV0(j)</tt>
<br><tt>StXiMuDst* GetXi(j)</tt>
<br><tt>StKinkMuDst* GetKink(j)</tt>
<br>- Use the input parameter <tt>j</tt> to specify the index of the vertex
from that event, with indices starting at zero for each event.
<br>- Append "Mc" or "Assoc" to the function name for Monte Carlo vertices
or associations between MC and reconstructed data.<p>
<p>

<li>Getting a pointer to the event information:
<br><tt>StStrangeEvMuDst* GetEvent()</tt>
<br><tt>StStrangeEvMuDst* GetMcEvent()</tt>
<p>

<li>Getting a pointer to the TTree used for the micro-DST:
<br><tt>TTree* GetTree()</tt>
<p>

<li>Getting access to the cuts on the micro-DST:
<br><tt>StStrangeCuts& Cuts()</tt>
<br>- See <a href="cuts.html">documentation for StrangeCuts</a>
<p>

<li>Getting a pointer to the
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TClonesArray">TClonesArray</a>
used for collecting instances of the component classes of the micro-DST:
<br><tt>TClonesArray* GetEvClonesArray()</tt>
<br><tt>TClonesArray* GetV0ClonesArray()</tt>
<br><tt>TClonesArray* GetXiClonesArray()</tt>
<br><tt>TClonesArray* GetKinkClonesArray()</tt>
<br>- From the TClonesArray, one can get a vertex with index <tt>j</tt> via
the <tt>operator[]</tt>, like <tt>(*(maker.GetV0ClonesArray()))[j]</tt>, but
this is more simply done with the <tt>Get*(j)</tt> member functions
described above.<p>

<li>Treating MC and reconstructed data the same (interfaces):
<br><tt>Get*I(Bool_t MC)</tt>
<br>- Switch easily back and forth between Monte Carlo and reconstructed data
via input boolean <tt>MC</tt>.
<br>- Return types are usable for Monte Carlo and reconstructed data
(i.e. <tt>StV0I</tt> is usable for both <tt>StV0MuDst</tt> and <tt>StV0Mc</tt>
data classes).
</ul>


<p>
<HR width=60%>
<p>

<a name="buffer"><h2>Buffer Sizes</h2></a>
The maker allocates a certain amount of buffer memory for each variable
stored. Optimally, one would like this buffer to be as large as possible,
reducing the time spent for I/O, and consequently reducing the number of
keys Root uses in its files (thereby reducing the file size). However,
with limited memory available on computers running the job, making this
buffer large makes the executable very large, and may lead to significant
virtual memory paging (disk swapping), thereby reducing the performance.
If other users are running jobs, the amount of available memory may be
very limited.
Default values of the buffer sizes have been chosen which accomodate the
usage of about 200 MB of memory for running with all branches activated.
But in some situations, the user may wish to changes these limits. To do
this, the following functions are provided:

<ul>
<li><tt>SetV0BufferSize(b)</tt>
<li><tt>SetXiBufferSize(b)</tt>
<li><tt>SetKinkBufferSize(b)</tt>
</ul>

where <tt>b</tt> is the buffer size in bytes for each of the variables
associated with the particular branch. The default values are 1024000
(1 MB) for the V0 and Xi branches, and 128000 (128 KB) for the Kink branch.
The event branch currently uses 64 KB per variable. The total memory used
is then a function of which branches are activated, as well as how many
variables are in each branch. The above functions must be called between
the instantiation of the maker, and the call to <tt>Init()</tt>.


<p>
<HR width=60%>
<p>

<a name="adding"><h2>Adding Content</h2></a>
You might wish to add more information to your
own MuDsts. This is done quite
simply using the <a href="#filtering">filtering</a> code.
An example is provided here:
<p>

Let's say I want to add a branch which contains a
little bit of information that describes an event. In
my example, I've made a new class called "StA"
with two values that describe the event. This is
what its header file looks like:
<pre>
#ifndef StA_hh
#define StA_hh
#include "TObject.h"
class StA : public TObject {
  public:
   StA() {}
   virtual ~StA() {}
   Int_t value1;
   Float_t value2;
   ClassDef(StA,1)
};
#endif
</pre>

Now I must modify the filterStrangeMuDst.C macro
to include the new information. Here are 3 steps:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Load the library for the new class:
<pre>
  gSystem->Load("myNewLibrary");
</pre>
<p>

<li>Assign a new branch (I called mine "ABranch")
for the new MuDst <b>after</b> the <tt>chain.Init()</tt>
call, but before the event loop:
<pre>
   StA::Class()->IgnoreTObjectStreamer(); // Don't store extra stuff
   TTree* tree = strangeNewDst.GetTree();
   TClonesArray* AArray = new TClonesArray("StA",1);
   tree->Branch("ABranch",&AArray,64000,99);
   StA* Ainstance = new((*AArray)[0]) StA();
</pre>

<li>Fill the data in the new branch during the
event loop. Here is a simple example where
I count Lambda candidates and their mean pt:
<pre>
     Int_t totalLams = 0;
     Float_t totalLamPt = 0.;
     for( Int_t j = 0; j &lt; strangeOldDst.GetNV0(); j++ ) {
       StV0MuDst *v0m = strangeOldDst.GetV0(j);
       Float_t ml = v0m->massLambda();
       if ((ml &gt; 1.11) && (ml &lt; 1.12)) {
         totalLams++;
         totalLamPt += v0m->ptV0();
       }
     }
     Ainstance->value1 = totalLams;
     Ainstance->value2 = totalLamPt/totalLams;
</pre>
</ol>

That's all there is to it. Your output MuDst will
contain the new branch with the new data. Simply
opening the new file in Root will allow you to do
things like making histograms with the new data
using <tt>TTree::Draw()</tt>. Reading the actual
class back will require adding code like this
after the <tt>chain.Init()</tt> of readStrangeMuDst.C:
<pre>
   TTree* tree = strangeNewDst.GetTree();
   TClonesArray* AArray = new TClonesArray("StA",0);
   tree->SetBranchStatus("ABranch.*",1);
   tree->SetBranchAddress("ABranch",&AArray);
</pre>
and using the following code during the event loop:
<pre>
     StA* Ainstance = (StA*) (AArray->At(0));
</pre>

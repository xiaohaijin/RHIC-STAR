Modification History
====================

06/28/99 Original version. Authors: Mike Lisa, Manuel Calderon de la Barca Sanchez

Description
===========

Takes the StEvent and StMcEvent objects
and builds multimaps so that one can query in
with a rec. hit or track, and get the associated
Monte Carlo hit or track.  In addition, for tracks
one is also interested in the number of common hits
the tracks have, so this information is also
available.

To be done
==========
Associate hits in SVT and FTPC.

Tests done
----------
Compiles on i386_redhat51, sun4x_56, and hp_ux102

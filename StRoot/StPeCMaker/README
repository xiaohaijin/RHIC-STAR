StPeCMaker

Description:
Example Maker for reading DSTs for peripheral collisions. It is
to be called from script doEvents.C (add one line to doEvents.C 
to call StPeCMaker). It takes information from the DST and fills 
a set of histograms. The dst information is transferred through
StEvent into StPeCEvent. An example of how to use StPeCEvent
is in the StPeCMaker member function StPeCMaker::ExampleAnalysis.

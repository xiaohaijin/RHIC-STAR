StMagF
==================

 Provides STAR Magnet Field values in kilogauss


Author: Bill Love, BNL,  with help from Yuri Fisyak

Usage
=====
  Base Class StMagF provides Agufld(*x, *b) which
 returns 3D field b in kG at the 3D point x (cm). 
  Derived from the base StMagF class are two classes:

  StMagFC provides for a constant field requiring
 z<280 and r<240 (TPC+ volume).
   Constructor is StMagFC(Name, Title, Factor)
 with two const char * and one Float_t arg which is
 a scale factor for the field, 1.0 = 5 kG in +z dir.

  StMagFCM provides a field from interpolation over
 a mesh with constant spacing.  The user must invoke
 the ReadField() method before calling Agufld.

ToDo
====
 Could make a more sophisticated interpolation over
 a finer mesh when needed.

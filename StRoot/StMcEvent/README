# The following are the "old" MC PXL hit structures:

StMcEvent/StMcPixelHit.hh
StMcEvent/StMcPixelHit.cc
StMcEvent/StMcPixelLayerHitCollection.hh
StMcEvent/StMcPixelLayerHitCollection.cc
StMcEvent/StMcPixelHitCollection.hh
StMcEvent/StMcPixelHitCollection.cc

# The new structures have some moficiations as prescribed below, 
# and the names have been changed. 
# So, I moved the old revision comments to the end of the files 
# and new containers will be regarded as new codes in CVS.
# All Id Log and ClassDef versions have been reset.

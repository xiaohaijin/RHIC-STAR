    <h2> New Version </h2>
    
    <p>
      The new version of <b>StMcEvent</b> is ready for testing.  A full description will
      be given in the User Guide.  The new
      User's Guide & Reference Manual
      is now ready too.  Gene made a nice page where the PS documentation
      can be obtained. 
      Click
      <a href="http://www.star.bnl.gov/STARAFS/comp/root/special_docs.html">here</a> to get to Gene's page.
      In the meantime,
      a description of the main changes in <b>StMcEvent</b> will be given below.  The aim is
      that it will help people get started while the more complete documentation is done.
      For quick reference, look at the brief <a href="#class description">class description</a>
      below.  This lists the most
      commonly used methods of the <a href="#class description"><i>StMcEvent</i></a>,
      <a href="#StMcTrack"><i>StMcTrack</i></a>, <a href="#StMcVertex"><i>StMcVertex</i></a> and

     <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
      <b>StMcEvent</b> is a package that compliments the use of <b>StEvent</b>, STAR's
      Data Model.
      The aim of this package is for the user to be able
      to access and analyze Monte Carlo with the same object oriented
      approach as <b>StEvent</b> . The top class is an instance of <i>StMcEvent</i>, and a
      pointer to this  class enables access to all the relevant Monte Carlo
      information.  When running through a typical STAR analysis chain, like the one
      in bfcread.C, a Maker does the actual filling of the <b>StMcEvent</b> objects.
      In this
      case, it is <b>StMcEventMaker</b>.  This Maker then has a member function to give
      to the other makers down the chain
      access to the instance of <i>StMcEvent</i>.  Through this pointer, one can then navigate
      through the tracks, vertices and hits in the event.  The 
      <a href="./ps/StMcEvent.psnup"> User's Guide</a> is now outdated.  The previous version
      contained a list of all
      the member functions of the previous <i>StMcEvent</i> class and all classes in the package.  The
      new version has a different structure, and more classes.  A good place to look in the meantime
      is the <b>StEvent</b> <a href="../../StEvent/doc/StEvent.pdf"> User's Guide</a>, since
      <b>StMcEvent</b> follows the basic structure of <b>StEvent</b>.  The classes, of course, are
      different, but most of the methods have the same names, and similar classes have similar names.  For
      example, the basic class out of which all tracks in <b>StEvent</b> are made out of, is
      <i>StTrack</i>.  In <b>StMcEvent</b>, all tracks are of type <i>StMcTrack</i>.  The difference is that
      <b>StEvent</b> has many kinds of tracks:  <i>StGlobalTrack</i>, <i>StPrimaryTrack</i> while <b>StMcEvent</b>
      only has <i>StMcTrack</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The information contained in <b>StMcEvent</b> is designed to be simply
    a reflection of the information already available in the existing
    g2t tables.  The primary keys and foreign keys are replaced by
    associations between classes through pointers.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <h2> Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, <b>StMcEvent</b> compiles and runs in Linux, Solaris and HP.  To use it,
      there is a macro available under CVS: $STAR/StRoot/macros/examples/<b>StMcEventReadMacro.C</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This macro will read a geant.root
      file (created using the bfc.C macro) and will load the <b>StMcEvent</b> objects from the
      tables found in that file.
      Note that it does not do any analysis or histogramming at all.  This step would be done later
      by the user once <b>StMcEvent</b> is loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a quick check to see if everything is in place can be made simply by running the
      macro on a particular file.  (The current default is
      /afs/rhic.bnl.gov/star/data/samples/*.geant.root)
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="courier">root4star[0] .x StMcEventReadMacro.C(1,"myfile.geant.root")</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first argument in this invocation is the number of events to process, and the second
      argument is the file name.
      A successful run ensures that a) the file is there, b) it contains the
      GEANT information, and c) you are able to run the packages in your environment.  You can
      then start thinking about what to do with the GEANT information.  
    </p>

    <p>
      However, looking at the Monte Carlo Data by itself doesn't provide the most fruitful possibility
      for analysis.
      That is why the main goal of <b>StMcEvent</b> is to be used in conjunction to <b>StEvent</b> to
      analyze reconstructed and Monte Carlo data together.  This is done using
      <b>StAssociationMaker</b>.  This package has its own
      <a href="../../StAssociationMaker/doc/index.html">documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One thing to keep in mind when using <b>StAssociationMaker</b> or any code that uses  <b>StEvent</b>
      is that these packages RELY ON THE NEW DST TABLES.  This means that to use them you have to make
      sure that the *.dst.root file you want to use can actually be read by  <b>StEvent</b>.  Moreover,
      most of the new dst files are NOT produced with their *.geant.root file.  So before running
      <b>StAssociationMaker</b>, make sure that
    <ul>
      <li> You are using a dst.root file that can be read by the new <b>StEvent</b>.
      <li> The geant.root file from the dst.root file you want to use was written out.
      <li> Both files are in the same directory.
    </ul>

    <h2>Conventions and use of Tracks from Particle Table</h2>
    <p>
      Originally, there was no particle table.  All tracks were obtained from
      the g2t_track table.  The flag "event generator label" from the g2t_track
      table gives you the index from the particle table where this particular
      track is found.  If this variable is zero, that means that the track is
      completely a geant track, and does not come from the event generator.  All
      tracks, in addition, have a primary key.  Each track also knows about its
      start and stop vertex, and those vertices in turn know about its parent
      and daughter tracks, so you could navigate forth and back in this way,
      going through the vertices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, enter the particle table.  First of all, there is no such thing as
      the corresponding vertex table for this.  All there is supposed to be in
      the table in terms of mother-daughter relationships is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> the index of the mother(s) of the particle
      <li> the index of the daughter(s) of the particle
    </ul>
    <p>
      When I looked at some hijing events, I saw that the daughter indices were
      ALWAYS ZERO.  No information was contained there. So at the moment I just
      don't use this (but this is something to take up with the simulations
      leader...) So all the information available there was the mother
      indices.  In addition, the event generator ID's are kept according to the
      PDG standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the track entries in StMcEvent is done in the following way:
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, I fill all entries from the particle table.  All entries up
      to this point will then have:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li> event generator label > 0
	<li> PDG Id > 0  (which doesn't mean it will be a sensible value, there are some PDG codes reserved for
	Monte Carlo Generators that are "by definition" undefined.)
	<li> key = 0
	<li> GEANT Id = 0
    </ul>

    If they have a parent (according to the "motherIndex" from particle.idmohep[0])
    we enter it.

  </p>
    <p>
      
      Notice that the event generator will probably have additional
      interactions, not necessarily only decays, that will give a parentage
      relationship EVEN IF ALL DECAYS ARE TURNED OFF.  Hijing for example,
      starts from the parton level, and the bookkeeping of the parton 
      interactions will yield as a result entries in the particle table which
      have a parent() != 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      After we fill from the particle table (and you already see that there will
      be some tracks that have parent!=0 at this level at least for some event
      generators) we fill the StMcEvent tracks from the g2t_track table.  This
      is done in the same way as before the particle table came into the
      game.  These tracks will then ALL have:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> key > 0
      <li> GEANT ID > 0
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Now here's the tricky part.  The tracks that come directly from the event
      generator will ALSO have "event generator label" > 0.  That's how we know
      where to find them in the particle table.  So this track should already
      have been entered into StMcEvent.  To avoid overcounting, I merge the
      information of both tables into a single StMcTrack.  These entries will
      then have
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> key > 0
      <li> event generator label > 0
      <li> PDG ID > 0
      <li> GEANT ID > 0
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      
      And if the relevant entry in the particle table has a parent (and I
      already said why this may be so even if decays are turned off) then we
      assign it to this track appropriately.  Maybe you're getting confused
      because as far as GEANT is concerned, these tracks don't have a
      parent.  But remember that now were crossing the boundaries of GEANT,
      and we're also looking in the particle table, and a track that in
      GEANT will have no parent, most probably will have one in the particle 
      table.  That is why I would NOT recommend
      checking whether parent() == 0 to determine if a track is
      primary.  Actually, if it IS zero, I would expect it to be one of the
      initial partons, and most certainly these will not have any associated
      tracks because they only live in the event generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      Now for all g2t_tracks, including those that came from the particle table,
      we know its parent vertex from the g2t_vertex table.  Then a relationship
      between them is established.  This is what determines which tracks come
      from the primary vertex and which ones don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      There is even a data member from the g2t_event table that specifies the
      number of primary tracks (at the table level).  In one of the checks I
      always make when debugging is that this number should equal 
    </p>
    <p>
      <center>
	<pre>
	mcEvent->primaryVertex()->daughters().size()
	</pre>
      </center>
    </p>
    <p>
      There shouldn't be any discrepancy when things are fine.  If there is a discrepancy, then
      this signals that something is amiss.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      So the easiest way to get the primary tracks from StMcEvent is:
      
      <center>
	<pre>
	mcEvent->primaryVertex()->daughters()
	</pre>
      </center>
      
    </p>
    <p>      
      This should be it! But just to check what we're doing, check when you
      loop over them if they have:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li> key > 0
      <li> Geant Id > 0
      <li> pdg Id > 0
      <li> event generator label > 0
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p>
      If one is looking for a particle that was decayed in the event generator and
      its products then passed to GEANT, then the only modification to the above procedure
      is to ask for the parent of the relevant primary particles we are interested in.  For example,
      if a phi is decayed into an e+e- pair, then we check whether the primary track is an
      electron and if so, look at its parent.  If it is a phi, we're done.

    <h2> Brief Class Description</h2>
    <h3> <i>StMcEvent</i> </h3>
    The top class is <i>StMcEvent</i>, and through it, all other objects like tracks and hits are accessed.  The
    information stored in the g2t_event table is also stored here:
    <pre>  
    unsigned long                eventGeneratorEventLabel() const;
    unsigned long                eventNumber() const;
    unsigned long                runNumber() const;              
    unsigned long                type() const;
    unsigned long                zWest() const;
    unsigned long                nWest() const;
    unsigned long                zEast() const;
    unsigned long                nEast() const;
    unsigned long                numberOfPrimaryTracks() const;
    float                        impactParameter() const;
    float                        phiReactionPlane() const;
    float                        triggerTimeOffset() const;
    </pre>    
    </p>
    <p>
      The other objects are accessed through the member functions:
    <pre>
    StMcVertex*                    primaryVertex();
    StSPtrVecMcVertex&             vertices();
    StSPtrVecMcTrack&              tracks();
    StMcTpcHitCollection*          tpcHitCollection();
    StMcSvtHitCollection*          svtHitCollection();
    StMcFtpcHitCollection*         ftpcHitCollection();
    </pre>
    These methods also have a const version, in case these are needed.
    </p>
    <h3> <i>Flat Arrays</i> </h3>    
    <p>
      The naming convention follows that of <b>StEvent</b>.  However, the underlying arrays in StEvent
      are persistent, and in StMcEvent these are really transient STL vectors.  The names mean roughly the
      following.  StPtrVecMcVertex is a VECtor of PoinTeRs to objects of type StMcVertex.  StSPtrVecMcVertex
      is a Structural VECtor of PoinTeRs to objects of type StMcVertex.  The difference is in terms of
      ownership.  The "Structural" array owns the objects it points to, and it is responsible for
      deleting the objects when the object itself gets deleted. 
      The other one does not own the objects it points to and is just responsible for deleting itself.
      This makes it easier for the developers to know who owns what to make sure
      that SOMEONE deletes the objects and that they DON'T get deleted twice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tracks and vertices in <b>StMcEvent</b> are stored in a flat array.  There is a difference
      with <b>StEvent</b> in that there is no need for Track Nodes, Global or Primary Tracks.  <b>StMcEvent</b>
      only has <i>StMcTracks</i>.
    </p>
    <h3> <i>Hit Collections</i> </h3>
    <p>
      The HitCollections, are now classes in themselves, hits are not stored in flat arrays like before.
      The idea is now to
      store the hits in an ordered manner, according to sub detector structure.  This is done in the
      follwing way:
    </p>
    <p>
      StMcTpcHitCollection -> StMcTpcSectorHitCollection -> StMcTpcPadrowHitCollection -> Hits
    </p>
    <p>
      StMcSvtHitCollection -> StMcSvtLayerHitCollection -> StMcSvtLadderHitCollection -> StMcSvtWaferHitCollection -> Hits
    </p>
    <p>
      StMcFtpcHitCollection -> StMcFtpcPlaneHitCollection -> Hits
    </p>
    <p>
      The FTPC Hit collection structure is different than StEvent because the Monte Carlo hits don't know
      about FTPC Sectors.  These are determined by the reconstruction based on the magnetic field, ExB
      distortions etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's example loop to get to the TPC Hits.  The loops for the SVT and FTPC will have the same
      structure, replacing a TPC "sector" with an SVT "layer" or an FTPC "plane", etc. as in the structure
      above.
      
      <pre>
StMcTpcHitCollection* mcTpcHitColl = mcEvent->tpcHitCollection();
  for (unsigned int iSector=0;
       iSector < mcTpcHitColl->numberOfSectors(); iSector++) {

    // Get the sector hit collection

    StTpcSectorHitCollection* tpcSectHitColl = rcTpcHitColl->sector(iSector);

      for (unsigned int iPadrow=0;
           iPadrow<tpcSectHitColl->numberOfPadrows(); iPadrow++) {

	// Get the Padrow hit collection of the sector 

	StTpcPadrowHitCollection* tpcPadRowHitColl = tpcSectHitColl->padrow(iPadrow);

	for (unsigned int iHit=0;
	     iHit<tpcPadRowHitColl->hits().size(); iHit++){

	  // get the hits in the padrow

	  StMcTpcHit mcTpcHit = tpcPadRowHitColl->hits()[iHit];

	  // use the hit now...
	    
      </pre>
   </p>
    The names of the methods are similar to those in <b>StEvent</b>,
    only the classes are named differently.

    Also note that the numbering scheme, as requested by the SVT group, has the hits
    returning a layer, ladder, wafer (SVT), sector, padrow (TPC) and plane (FTPC) starting
    from 1.  So if you use these methods along with arrays, make sure to subtract 1.  This is
    also discussed in the <b>StEvent</b> manual.

    <a name="StMcTrack"></a>
    <h3> <i>StMcTrack</i> </h3>
    Here is a list of the methods most commonly used for StMcTrack.  The "set" methods, constructors, and
    other operators are not shown here.  An StMcTrack has knowledge of its four-momentum (and functions derived
    from this), the hits that form a part of this track and the type of particle that produced the track.
    
    <pre>
    const StLorentzVectorF&      fourMomentum() const;
    const StThreeVectorF&        momentum() const; 
    float                        energy() const; 
    float                        pt() const; 
    float                        rapidity() const; 
    float                        pseudoRapidity() const; 
    StMcVertex*                  startVertex(); 
    StMcVertex*                  stopVertex(); 
    StPtrVecMcVertex&            intermediateVertices();
    StPtrVecMcTpcHit&            tpcHits(); 
    StPtrVecMcSvtHit&            svtHits(); 
    StPtrVecMcFtpcHit&           ftpcHits(); 
    StParticleDefinition*        particleDefinition(); 
    int                          isShower() const; // 1 = yes, 0 = no
    long                         geantId() const;
    </pre>

    <a name="StMcVertex"></a>
    <h3> <i>StMcVertex</i> </h3>
    The vertices in <b>StMcEvent</b> know their position, geant volume, time of flight, geant
    process that produced them and, more importantly, the daughter tracks and parent track.

    <pre>
    const StThreeVectorF&       position() const;
    StPtrVecMcTrack&            daughters();
    unsigned int                numberOfDaughters();
    StMcTrack*                  daughter(unsigned int);
    const StMcTrack*            parent();
    string                      geantVolume() const;
    float                       tof() const;
    long                        geantProcess() const;
    </pre>
    
    <a name="StMcHit"></a>
    <h3> <i>StMcHit</i> </h3>
    All hit classes inherit from <i>StMcHit</i>, which provides the following methods:
    <pre>
    const StThreeVectorF& position() const;
    float                       dE() const; // energy loss
    float                       dS() const; // path length within padrow
    StMcTrack*         parentTrack() const;
    </pre>
    <p>
      In addition, the derived hit classes know which subdetector they belong to:
    </p>
    <p> <i>StMcTpcHit</i> </p>
    <pre>
    unsigned long sector() const; // 1-24
    unsigned long padrow() const; // 1-45
    </pre>
    <p> <i>StMcSvtHit</i> </p>
    <pre>
    unsigned long layer()  const; // layer=[1-6]
    unsigned long ladder() const; // ladder=[1-8]
    unsigned long wafer()  const; // wafer=[1-7]
    unsigned long barrel() const; // barrel=[1-3]
    </pre>
    <p> <i>StMcFtpcHit</i> </p>
    <pre>
    unsigned long plane()  const; // 1-20
    </pre>

    This covers the basic classes and the methods that will most frequently be needed to
    use <b>StMcEvent</b>.  The header files are nevertheless the definitive and more
    complete source, and these can be accessed from the

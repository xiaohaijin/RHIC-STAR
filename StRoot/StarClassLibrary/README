* README File for StarClassLibrary
==================================

** Introduction
---------------
The StarClassLibrary (or SCL) is a C++ class library which
contains general purpose classes such as:
   3- and 4-vectors
   matrices
   helices
   particle definitions
   ascii file parser
   command line prompt routines
   random generators

The classes are written in vanilla C++ and do not depend
on other packages. This allows their usage also in small
stand-alone applications. StEvent and StMcEvent make
heavy use of them.
Many classes are based on similar classes from:
CLHEP, NA45, Geant4 and RogueWave but without their
inherent dependencies.

The SCL contains a lot of templates which causes trouble
when using these classes in ROOT, or better in CINT.
Most of the affected classes therefore have an equivalent
non-templated version. All this is explained in detail
in the documentation.

** Documentation
----------------
*** On paper
There is only ONE source of documentation and that
is the "StarClassLibrary User Guide and Reference Manual".
This README file is only to tell you how to get it:

	cvs checkout StRoot/StarClassLibrary
        cd StRoot/StarClassLibrary/doc/tex
        make

'make' will make StarClassLibrary.ps. Since the document
is rather large (> 100 pages) it's best to print it on
a duplex printer.
'make' assumes that LaTeX and dvips is installed on your machine.
There's also an 'make pdf' which creates an pdf file with
bookmarks and hyperlinks.
If you cannot manage to make them, have a look at the following
URL: http://www.star.bnl.gov/STARAFS/comp/root/special_docs.html
There you always get the actual 'dev' version of the manual.

** Outline of the directory structure
-------------------------------------
*** StarClassLibrary:
Contains all header and source files
and the README file you are browsing.

*** StarClassLibrary/doc:
Contains the documentation and an
index.html file which redirects to the
SCL Home Page.

**** StarClassLibrary/doc/tex:
LaTeX documentation. This is the only real source of
documentation there is. This is the one you need!

*** StarClassLibrary/examples:
Small, stand-alone example programs and a GNUmakefile.
These programs are used to test almost all methods of
the referring classes. They are especially useful when
developing or debugging code or porting to new platforms. 

** Authors
----------
The SCL was written by Brian Lasiuk and Thomas Ullrich.

This directory contains example programs to test
the different classes and functions from the
StarClassLibrary (SCL).

Do the usual:
	mkdir wrk
	cd wrk
	cvs checkout StRoot/StarClassLibrary
	cd StRoot/StarClassLibrary/examples
(If you read this you probably have done this already)

The GNUmakefile compiles the individual test programs.
As the name already implies you have to use the GNU make
program. On Linux this is the standard:

linux> make <example>

On other platforms the GNU make is often called 'gmake':

hp/sun> gmake <example>

where <example> is the name of one of the examples.

The following environment variable must be defined:
CERN
STAR_SYS
If you run the standard STAR login script you don't have
to worry. If not, you have to set them by hand.

Please note, that in order to compile and link the various
examples the SCL classes are directly compiled, i.e. the
official STAR distribution $STAR/lib is NOT used. This
is necessary since $STAR/lib/StarClassLibrary.so contains
dependencies to ROOT classes (TObject, TBuffer) which
would require to link with all ROOT libraries. Here we
only want to test small stand-alone classes. This also
eases the work of the developer.
The makefile requires the SCL sources to be one directory
up (-I..).

There are also two small shell scripts 'makeall.sh' and
'runall.sh' which do exactly what their name imply.

If you want to get rid of all the *.o and executables use
'gmake clean'. 

The GNUmakefile was tested on HP (aCC), Sun (CC4.2) and
Linux (egcs).

\section{Philosophy and Motivation} \index{philosophy}
\label{Philosophy}

Code-reusability is often claimed to be one of the most important
benefits to be realized from Object-Oriented programming.  This
is not really a new concept, especially in High Energy
Physics (HEP) where many Fortran subroutine libraries, most notably
CERNLIB\footnote{http://wwwcn1.cern.ch/asd/index.html}
have been used for many years.  There are however, several distinct
differences between such subroutine libraries and class libraries
which Object-Oriented languages allow.  First standardized data
structures, or containers, along with operations associated with such
objects are combined in classes.  Second, with subroutine libraries
one does not have the opportunity to extend or alter the functionality
of a routine unless the source code is available and recompilation
is possible.  On the other hand, Object-Oriented languages like C++ allows
the user to produce a derived class via inheritance which one can add
functionality through the addition of member
functions \index{member functions}
or data storage through the addition of data members.

Most C++ compilers come with what is called the ``Standard C++
Library''\index{Standard C++ Library} which defines generic container
classes (i.e.~linked lists, sorted lists, etc.) and simple algorithms
associated with these containers.  However the needs of the HEP community
are much more specialized in terms of the containers we use---things
like three- and four-vectors, random number generators, matrices, etc.,
and such objects are poorly dealt with in expensive commercial class
libraries.  It was with this motivation that  Leif L\"{o}nnblad proposed
{\em A Class Library for High Energy Physics} (CLHEP) \index{CLHEP} in C++ at the
{\em Computing in High Energy Physics} (CHEP) conference in 1992.  This library provided
basic HEP specific classes and although it went a long way in providing a
standard for C++ in HEP, C++ was not a mature nor standardized language
at the time.  Recently (December 1997) an ANSI committee has proposed
an international standardization of the C++
language\footnote{http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/nov97/}
which makes some components of CLHEP redundant and some other parts
unnecessarily inflexible (i.e.~adding three-vectors with elements of
different types).

For these reasons it was felt that the basic component classes of CLHEP
(like vectors and matrices) could be rewritten incorporating contemporary
new standardized features of the C++
language.  These include the use of templates, exception handling,
namespaces, use of the Standard Template Library (STL)
\index{Standard Template Library}
\index {STL} etc.  It was also felt that additional functionality specific
to the STAR experiment could be incorporated to make this a real
STAR Class Library (SCL); things like implementing the STAR track model,
data base interfaces etc.  Even a simple interface to HBOOK is included.
The code in the SCL is written to conform to the ANSI standard
and conventions of the Standard C++ Library.  The directory
and \texttt{Makefile} structure is modelled very closely after the
pioneering work of the GEANT4 collaboration.  Documentation is also seen as
an important component of this development.  This manual provides a detailed
description of each class, its functionality, its dependencies, as well as
a description of all user accessible member functions.  Example programs
and there expected output are also included.  More detailed examples
testing the functionality of each and every member function are provided in
the \comp{examples} directory in the library itself.  Web based documentation,
giving the user access to the header files and source code is foreseen
in the near future.

These developments have been made in consultation with the CERN LHC++
group who maintain the official version of CLHEP and they have
expressed interest in perhaps incorporating some of this library
in a future release.  This is also by no means a complete library and as
more and more people get involved with development, it is expected to
expand.  So look through the manual and feel free to
make any comments, good or bad to the collaboration and developers.



\section{Platforms and Compilers} \index{compiler} \index{platform}
\label{platformsAndCompilers}

The \name{StarClassLibrary} (SCL) \index{SCL} is currently tested on the
following platforms and compilers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item HP-UX 10.20: \index{HP-UX}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item aCC A.01.06 or higher versions. \index{aCC (HP compiler)}
    \item gcc/g++ 2.9.5.
  \end{itemize}
\item Red Hat Linux 5.1 to Red Hat Linux 6.1: \index{Linux}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item gcc/g++ 2.91.66 or higher.
  \end{itemize}
\item Solaris 2.4--2.6: \index{Solaris}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CC 4.2 and modified Object Space 2.0.2 Standard Library. \index{Object Space}
    \item CC 5.0 or higher
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
Tests with Visual C++ 5.0 fail because of the lack of support of \index{Visual C++}
templated member functions and a broken overloading mechanism. Visual C++ 6.0 is not
tested yet.
Further tests on AIX and IRIX are not foreseen unless there is sufficient user demand.
\index{Irix} \index{AIX}

\section{Organization of the SCL}

All documentation, code, and header files of the SCL is contained in a
directory named \name{StarClassLibrary}.
It contains 2 further sub-directories:
\name{./examples} and \name{./doc}.

To summarize:
\vspace{-11pt}
\begin{description}
\item[\name{StarClassLibrary}] is the top directory,
\begin{description}
\item[\name{./}] contains the different header files
    (extension \name{.h} and \name{.hh}),
and the referring source code (extension \name{.cc}),
\item[\name{./doc}] contains all SCL documentations,. This directory is
    further divided up in \name{./doc/tex} for the \LaTeX guide (this document)
    and \name{./doc/html} for a class browser. Both subdirectories
    contain makefiles in order to prepare the final document from the
    various sources.
\item[\name{./examples}] contains small self-describing programs to test and
    demonstrate most the features of every classes. There is a
    \name{GNUmakefile}
    provided to compile and link the non-ROOT versions of the examples.
    Note that, except on Linux, you have to use \comp{gmake} in order to
    process the makefile since it contains several GNU extension. Please
    read the \name{examples/README} file for further instructions.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\section{Accessing the SCL}  \index{Accessing SCL}

The SCL is part of the official STAR software distribution
and is therefore present in the actual STAR software releases.

The {\em StarClassLibrary} is under {\bf CVS} control at BNL.  It can
be accessed via \name{afs}: \index{afs} \index{CVS} \index{CVSROOT}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Obtain an \name{afs} token: \comp{klog -cell rhic}.
  \item Make sure \comp{\$CVSROOT} is set properly:\\
    (i.e.~\comp{CVSROOT = /afs/rhic.bnl.gov/star/packages/repository})
  \item Check-out package into your current working directory:\\
    \comp{cvs checkout StRoot/StarClassLibrary}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Macros} \index{macros} \label{Macros}

The \name{StarClassLibrary} is coded under the assumption that all
ANSI features are available. If the used compiler is fully ANSI
compliant the SCL will compile without any modifications.\\
Because the new C++ ANSI standard pushes the limits of current \index{ANSI}
compiler technology, a number of compiler and Standard C++ Library \index{Standard C++ Library}
features are often missing or implemented in a way that differs from
the ANSI standard.\\
In order to use the SCL also on those systems various macros were defined
which either disable certain features, e.g. exception handling, or use
slightly modified (and less elegant) code.
The following macros are used throughout the SCL.
If the STAR environment is installed properly they should be defined
according to your platform/compiler.

\begin{description}
\item[\comp{ST\_NO\_MEMBER\_TEMPLATES}:] defined if the compiler does
    not support template member functions.
    \index{ST\_NO\_MEMBER\_TEMPLATES}
\item[\comp{ST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS}:] defined if the compiler does not
    support exception handling. \index{ST\_NO\_EXCEPTIONS}
\item[\comp{ST\_NO\_NUMERIC\_LIMITS}:] defined if the STL class
    \name{numeric\_limits} is not available (it is usually located in
    the $<$\comp{limits}$>$ header file).
    \index{ST\_NO\_NUMERIC\_LIMITS}
\item[\comp{ST\_NO\_TEMPLATE\_DEF\_ARGS}:] defined if the compiler
    does not support template default arguments
    \index{ST\_NO\_TEMPLATE\_DEF\_ARGS}
\item[\comp{ST\_NO\_NAMESPACES}:] defined if the compiler does not
    support multiple namespaces.\index{ST\_NO\_NAMESPACES}
\item[\comp{ST\_OLD\_CLHEP\_SYSTEM\_OF\_UNITS}:] user defined if one
    must use units as defined in CLHEP v1.2 (use of this macro is
    strongly discouraged).\index{ST\_OLD\_CLHEP\_SYSTEM\_OF\_UNITS}
\item[\comp{NO\_HBOOK\_INIT}:] restricts the automatic initialization
    of HBOOK memory.
\item[\comp{ST\_SOLVE\_TEMPLATES}:] force the instantiation of SCL
    templates when using \texttt{StTemplates.hh} (see reference
    section for more).
\item[\comp{\_\_ROOT\_\_}:] This macro is automatically set if the
    header files are processed in a ROOT environment. If you want to
    use the SCL in a standalone mode you can either use the templated
    versions of the classes or undefine this flag in order to
    eliminate any ROOT dependencies. \index{\_\_ROOT\_\_}
\end{description}

\section{Documentation} \index{documentation} \index{class browser} \index{HTML}

The SCL documentation consists of the {\em User Guide and Reference
    Manual} located in \name{StarClassLibrary/doc/tex}, i.e.  this
document. This directory contains a Makefile which allows to create
either a PS version (\texttt{make}) or a PDF version (\texttt{make
    pdf}). The latter also includes bookmarks and allows to follow
references in the text via hyperlinks. PDF is certainly the preferred
format since it combines the advantages of HTML (links) and PostScript
(printing) in one version. If you have trouble creating either the PS
or the PDF version because of missing applications (LaTeX, dvips,
dvipdf) you can get the current ``\texttt{dev}'' versions at the
following URL:
\texttt{http://www.star.bnl.gov/STARAFS/comp/root/special\_docs.html}.

\section{Known Problems} \index{limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item The SCL should compile without any compiler warnings except on
    \name{Sun} \index{Sun} platforms with CC4.2 due to shortcomings of
    the compiler.
\item The \name{Sun} compiler verion CC4.2 does not provide the
    Boolean data type \comp{bool}. \index{bool} Therefore \comp{bool}
    is implemented as integer type (\comp{int}).  As a consequence
    overloading of (member) functions according to \comp{bool/int}
    types is not possible. Note that the StPrompt \index{StPrompt}
    class is affected (see section \ref{ref:StPrompt}).
\item In order to run programs built with the shared version of the
    SCL and standard library on Sun platforms with CC4.2, it is
    necessary to define an environment variable,
    \comp{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}, \index{LD LIBRARY PATH}to indicate the
    directory containing the shared library.
\item If you are using an old \texttt{cfront} compiler \index{cfront
        compiler} who still uses template databases or repositories
    you might encounter unresolved symbols when linking with the SCL
    library.  In order to avoid this problem one has to include
    \comp{StTemplates.hh}\index{StTemplates} once somewhere in the
    application. The only known platform where this is necessary is
    SUN with the CC4 compiler. Note, that one also has to set the
    \comp{ST\_SOLVE\_TEMPLATES} flag in order to enable the template
    instantiation.  By setting or omitting this macro in the referring
    Makefile one can selectively switch the forced instantiation on
    and off.
\item The SCL uses heavily the Standard C++ Library and thus
    templates. In certain cases such as the CINT \index{CINT}
    interpreter used by ROOT \index{ROOT} the use of the template SCL
    classes (or classes using templates) is not possible.  Here one
    has to use the equivalent non-template version.
    Table~\ref{tab:templates} gives an overview of the available
    non-template/non-STL classes. Please note that the template
    versions should be used whenever possible.
\end{itemize}
\begin{table}[htb]
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{template class} & \textbf{non-template class} \\ \hline
        \verb+StThreeVector<float>+ & \verb+StThreeVectorF+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StThreeVector<double>+ & \verb+StThreeVectorD+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StLorentzVector<float>+ & \verb+StLorentzVectorF+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StLorentzVector<double>+ & \verb+StLorentzVectorD+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StMatrix<float>+ & \verb+StMatrixF+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StMatrix<double>+ & \verb+StMatrixD+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StHelix+ & \verb+StHelixD+ \\ \hline
        \verb+StPhysicalHelix+ & \verb+StPhysicalHelixD+ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Template classes and their non-template/non-STL equivalents.}
    \label{tab:templates}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

All non-template classes listed in the table can be used in ROOT. The SCL library also
contains the referring ROOT dictionary. Note that this increases the size of the classes
by $\sim$ 12 byte depending on the platform.

\section{Support and Reporting Bugs} \index{support}
Currently the \name{StarClassLibrary} is supported by a small group.  Hopefully
as more people begin to use it and add to it, there will be a larger
support base for it.  If there is a problem or bug, report it to
one or more of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item starsoft-l@bnl.gov
  \item starsofi-l@bnl.gov
  \item brian.lasiuk@yale.edu
  \item thomas.ullrich@yale.edu

\section{Global Constants and Definitions}
There is a distinction between the header files which define
the STAR data types, system of units, physical constants,
simple macros, etc. from those files that actually contain
class definitions.  This section contains the headers that
are necessary to operate in the STAR C++ programming environment.

\subsection{StGlobals}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StGlobals defines the STAR data types as well as simple
    macros and templates.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StGlobals.hh"+


\item[Description]
    Contains SCL-wide definitions. Since it also contains
    a few small template functions its use is restricted to
    environments which support templates. It also serves as an interface to

\subsection{SystemOfUnits} \index{System of units}
\label{SystemOfUnits}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    SystemOfUnits defines a set of consistent SI units.
    All are defined as \comp{static const HepDouble}.
    The units are backwards compatible with CLHEP v1.2.

\item[Synopsis]
  \verb+#define ST_ADD_OLD_CLHEP_SYSTEM_OF_UNITS // if necessary+
  \verb+#include "SystemOfUnits.h"+


\item[Description] SystemOfUnits differs from version 1.2 of
    CLHEP\index{CLHEP} by using the complete name of the unit.  In
    this manner there is no pollution of the global namespace with
    single character constants like 'm' for meter, 's' for second,
    etc.  The previous units from CLHEP are still available but the
    user must define a flag
    \texttt{ST\_ADD\_OLD\_CLHEP\_\-SYSTEM\_\-OF\_UNITS} before including
    \texttt{SystemOfUnits.h}.  One other important difference is that
    the constants as defined in the header file are contained in a
    namespace {\bf namespace units}. \index{namespace} If your
    compiler does not support namespaces, the macro
    \texttt{ST\_NO\_NAMESPACES} must be defined and the constants will
    reside in the global namespace!

    Note, that the base units are currently mapped to the ones in
    GEANT3\index{GEANT3} (cm, GeV, s).  This is likely to change in
    future. Any changes to the base units, however, do not effect your
    code at all as long as you use \texttt{SystemOfUnits}
    consistently.

\subsubsection{Basic Concept}

There are essentially two base classes which  define the interface
to STARs "Definition of Particles": \comp{StParticleDefinition} and
\comp{StParticleTable}.

\comp{StParticleDefinition} aggregates information to characterize
particles property such as name, mass, spin and life time, while
\comp{StParticleTable} is a container class which holds a list of all
available particle definitions and allows to query for particle definitions
if only the name or the numeric identifier (GEANT3 or PDG) of a particle is known.

The StarClassLibrary provides the \comp{StParticleDefinition} class to
represent particles. Various particles such as electron, proton, and
gamma have their own classes derived from \comp{StParticleDefinition}.
These concrete pre-defined particles, however, do not directly inherit
from \comp{StParticleDefinition} but indirectly through a layer of abstract
classes which determins the particle "type".  The following types are defined:
\comp{StMeson}, \comp{StBaryon}, \comp{StLepton}, \comp{StIon} and \comp{StBoson}.
The UML diagrams for the underlying design are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:umlPart}
in section \ref{sec:umlPart}.

\subsubsection{Implementation of Particles}

The idea and design of the \comp{StParticleDefinition} class and all
concrete particle classes derived from it is largely based on the
design of the \comp{G4ParticleDefinition} class from Geant4
(RD44)\index{Geant4}.  Although the code is in large parts different
(modified or rewritten) and adapted to the STAR framework the basic
idea stays the same.

An individual class is defined for each predefined particle. The
object in each class is unique and defined as a static object (so-called
singleton).  Users can get pointers to such objects by using static
methods in these classes.

\subsubsection{StParticleDefinition}
\index{StParticleDefinition}

The \comp{StParticleDefinition} class has "read-only" properties which
characterize the individual particle such as name, mass, charge, spin, and
so on. These properties are set during initialization of each particle.
Operators and methods to get these properties are listed below. Note,
that the class itself is not a singleton but all derived concrete
classes are.

\subsubsection{Predefined Particles}

The StarClassLibrary provide currently 77 predefined particles. They are listed in
table \ref{tab:leptons}-\ref{tab:baryons} in section \ref{sec:predefpart}.
Note that the PDG encoding is  defined for elementary particles only
and not for ions. GEANT3 IDs are listed for completeness only. They are not
part of a particle definition. See section \ref{sec:partTable} on how to
get a particle definition for a given GEANT3 ID.

particle class is defined in one header file. The name of the header file is simply
the name of the class plus the .hh extension.
As mentioned above all particles are implemented as singletons, i.e. only one instance
(a static object) exist. This minimizes the memory usage and ensures coherent definitions.

Each of the predefined classes has a member function \comp{instance()} which returns
a pointer to the only existing object. All constructors, including the copy constructor
and the assignment operator are private to ensure that no second copy can be created.
The following code demonstrates how to obtain a $\pi^-$.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#include "StPionMinus.hh"

void example1()
{
     StPionMinus *pim = StPionMinus::instance();
     cout << *pim << endl;
}
\end{verbatim}
}

Please remember that no copy of an instance can be made. The following code
does not compile.

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
      StPionMinus pim = *(StPionMinus::instance()); // ERROR, assignment operator is private
\end{verbatim}
}

As already mentioned above there is an additional layer of abstract classes
between \comp{StParticleDefinition} and the concrete classes (see also Fig.~\ref{fig:umlPart}).
This layer allows to distinguish particles according to their type (baryon, meson, etc).
They do not add any data member or overwrite any functions; with other words there's no overhead involved.
The idea behind this is best illustrated in the following example:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
void fillHistos(StMeson*);    // version 1
void fillHistos(StBaryon*);   // version 2

void MyMCAnalysis(StParticleDefinition* particle)
{
    cout << "Got a " << particle->name() << endl;
    cout << "The pdg mass of this guy is: " << particle->mass() << endl;
    fillHisto(particle);   // calls version 1 if particle is a meson, 2 if its a baryon
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{Header Files}

Each particle is defined in a separate header file.
This results in an enormous amount of header files and include statements
one has to deal with. To make life easier there is one header file which contains
them all: \comp{StParticleTypes.hh}. Note that you still have to include
\comp{StParticleTable.hh} if you want to use the particle table.


But remember that in many situations the header files of the pre-defined particles
do not necessarily have to be included. Since the base class already defines the
entire interface it is often sufficient to include \comp{StParticleDefinition.hh} only. This
reduces the dependencies of your code and therefore the compile time.
Here are two example where you don't need the header of the specific particles:

{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
#include "StParticleDefinition.hh"
#include "StParticleTable.hh"

void example2(StParticleDefinition* p)
{
     if (p == StParticleTable::instance()->findParticle("pi+")) {
           cout << "Got pi+" << endl;
           cout << "Mass is: " << p->mass() << endl;
     }
}

void example3(StParticleDefinition* p)
{
      if (p->baryonNumber() != 0 && p->type() == "meson") {
          cout << "Oops, this cannot be ..." << endl;
          cout << "Check this funny particle:" << endl;
          cout << *p << endl;
      }
}
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsubsection{How to Define a New Particle}

This is easy. All you need is the data to define the particle: mass,
lifetime, spin, etc.  The safest (and fastest) way to proceed is to
use one of the existing particle classes of the \emph{same} type (ion,
meson, baryon, lepton, boson) as a template. All you have to do is to
replace all occurrences of the old class name with the new name in the
header (.hh) and source (.cc) file.  All what is left now is to
replace the arguments passed to the constructor of the static data
member with the new ones.

There's no need to register the new particle definition in the
particle table. The constructor of the base class
(\comp{StParticleDefinition}) does this automatically for you.

\subsubsection{The Particle Table}
\label{sec:partTable}

All particles are automatically registered in the particle table. The
particle table is also a singleton, i.e., only one instance can be
created. To obtain an pointer to the one and only instance one has to
use the \comp{instance()} member function or obtain the pointer
through any predefined particle using its
\comp{StParticleDefinition::particleTable()} member function.\\
The class actually holds several maps which allow fast access to
available particle definitions by name, PDG encoding, or GEANT3 Id.
Remember that some particles have no corresponding GEANT3 Id and
PDG encoding does not exist for ions.  STAR extended the list of
particle IDs in GSTAR to overcome the limited coverage of elementary
particles in GEANT3. They are taken into account.

\subsubsection{StParticleTable}
\index{StParticleTable}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StParticleTable.hh"+\\
    \verb+typedef vector<StParticleDefinition*> StVecPtrParticleDefinition;+\\

\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    None.\\
    All constructors, including the copy constructor
    and the assignment operator are private to ensure that
    no second copy can be created.

\item[Public Member\\ Functions]
    \verb+static StParticleTable* instance();+\\
    Returns pointer to the only existing instance of self.

    \verb+static StParticleTable* particleTable();+\\
    Returns pointer to the only existing instance of self.
    Same as \comp{instance()}.

    \verb+unsigned int entries() const;+\\
    Number of entries in the table, i.e. number of
    defined particles.

    \verb+unsigned int size() const;+\\
    Number of entries in the table, i.e. number of
    defined particles. Same as \comp{entries()}.

    \verb+bool contains(const string & pname) const;  +\\
    Returns true if particle with name \args{pname} is defined.

    \verb+bool contains(int pdgId) const;   +\\
    Returns true if particle with PDG encoding \args{pdgId} is defined.

    \verb+bool containsGeantId(int gId) const; +\\
    Returns true if particle with GEANT3 ID \args{gId} is defined.

    \verb+StParticleDefinition* findParticle(const string& pname) const;+\\
    Returns pointer to particle with name \args{pname} or a null
    pointer if the particle is not defined.

    \verb+StParticleDefinition* findParticle(int pdgId)  const; +\\
    Returns pointer to particle with PDG encoding \args{pdgId} or a null
    pointer if the particle is not defined.

    \verb+StParticleDefinition* findParticleByGeantId(int gId) const;+\\
    Returns pointer to particle with GEANT3 ID encoding \args{gId} or a null
    pointer if the particle is not defined.

    \verb+void insert(StParticleDefinition* part);+\\
    Insert new particle definition \args{part} "by hand".
    Note, that this is not necessary
    since each defined particle is automatically registered
    (using this member function).

    \verb+void erase(StParticleDefinition* part);+\\
    Removes given particle definition \args{part} from the table.

    \verb+void dump(ostream& os = cout);+\\
    Dumps (prints) all particles defined in the table to ostream
    \args{os}. Note, that \args{os} defaults to cout (stdout).

    \verb+StVecPtrParticleDefinition allParticles() const;+\\
    Returns a vector of pointers to all particle definitions stored
    in the table.

\item[Warnings]
    The order of the particles in the table is arbitrary and
    system dependent. Adding new particles might alter
    the order as well. Do not write code that relies on indices
    into a vector obtained from \comp{allParticles()}

\subsubsection{List of Predefined Particle Definitions}
\label{sec:predefpart}

Tables \ref{tab:leptons} to \ref{tab:baryons} list\footnote{See
    example 3 in section \ref{sec:pex} on how this list was created.}
all predefined particle definitions. The meaning of the different
columns are:
\begin{description}
\item[Particle Name:] An unique, descriptive name assigned to each
    particle.  This name can be used in \comp{StParticleTable} to
    obtain a pointer to the actual particle definition.
\item[PDG Encoding:] The number assigned to this particle by the
    Particle Data Group.
\item[GEANT3 Ids:] The number GEANT3 uses to reference this type of
    particle.  The table also includes IDs defined for GSTAR (STAR
    specific).
\item[Class Name:] Name of the class. Use
    \comp{St}\args{ClassName}\comp{::instance()} to get a pointer to
    the referring particle definition.
\item[Derived From:] Name of the base class. This defines also the
    type of the particle.

%    Reference: StAngle
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{StAngle} \index{StAngle} \label{StAngle}
\index{angles}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
     The StAngle class represents an angle in radians and provide
     all essential operation in an unambigious way.

\item[Synopsis]
  \verb+#include "StAngle.hh"+ \\
  \verb+class StAngle;+\\

\item[Description]
  This class represents an angle in units of radians. It behaves
  pretty much like a \texttt{double} but ensures that its value
  always stay in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$. Essentially all operations
  as multiplication, addition, subtraction, or scaling are overloaded.
  This class is especially useful if you deal with azimuthal symmetric
  problems since it handles differences between angles correctly and avoids
  the usual problems related to the $0 \rightarrow 2 \pi$ transition.
  This saves a lot of checks within the code as compared to using
  simple \texttt{float}s or \texttt{double}s to represent angles.

  However, this class should not be used when speed is crucial since
  it carries quite some overhead. Use it when reliability and safety
  are major issues.

\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    \verb+StAngle();+\\
    Default constructor.

    \verb+StAngle(const StAngle&);+\\
    Copy constructor.

    \verb+StAngle(double alpha);+\\
    Create angle with \texttt{alpha} radians. \texttt{alpha} is automatically
    adjusted to fall in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.


\item[Public Member\\ Functions]
    \verb+double degree();+\\
    Returns the angle in degree. The return value is always in the range
    $[0^\circ - 360^\circ]$. Please note that this is the only safe method
    to obtain the angle in degree. See ``pitfalls'' below.

\item[Public Member\\ Operators]
    \verb+operator double() const;+\\
    Transforms a \texttt{StAngle} into a \texttt{double} (type cast operator).
    Since this operator is defined one can use an StAngle everywhere where a
    \texttt{double} or \texttt{float} can be used.
    Essentially one can ignore this operator. It works for you in the background.

    \verb+StAngle operator= (double angle);+\\
    Assignement operator. Initiate self with an angle (in radian)
    keeping self in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

    \verb#StAngle operator+= (StAngle angle);#\\
    Add another \texttt{angle} to self, keeping self in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$

    \verb+StAngle operator-= (StAngle angle);+\\
    Subtract \texttt{angle} from self. The difference will always be the
    smallest possible difference. To give an example (for simplicity in degrees):
    $380^\circ - 10^\circ$ is $10^\circ$ not $370^\circ$.

    \verb+StAngle operator*= (double angle);+\\
    \verb+StAngle operator/= (double angle);+\\
    Multiply (divide) self by \texttt{angle}. Self stays in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

    \verb+int operator== (const StAngle& angle);+\\
    Comparison operator. Note that $x$ equals $x + n 2 \pi$.

\item[Global Functions]
    \verb+StAngle average(StAngle alpha, StAngle beta);+\\
    Returns the average of two angles \texttt{alpha} and \texttt{beta}.
    To give an example (for simplicity in degrees):
    the average of $380^\circ$ and $10^\circ$ is $15^\circ$ not $195^\circ$.

\item[Global Operators]
    \verb#StAngle operator+ (StAngle alpha, StAngle beta);#\\
    \verb+StAngle operator- (StAngle alpha, StAngle beta);+\\
    \verb+StAngle operator* (StAngle alpha, double c);+\\
    \verb+StAngle operator/ (StAngle alpha, double c);+\\
    Operators to allow to add, subtract two angles as well as
    scale and divide angles by a scalar. The results always will
    be a \texttt{StAngle} with a value in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

\item[Pitfalls]

    \texttt{StAngle} will always try to stay within its
    range ($[-\pi, \pi]$).  This way you can scale angles. The pitfall
    here is if you for example want to calculate its value in degree
    without using the \texttt{degree()} method.

    \verb+StAngle a = 2.7;+\\
    \verb+cout << a*180/pi << endl;  // doesn't work+\\

    will \textbf{not} work. The expression \texttt{a*180/pi} consist
    of a StAngle times a double which matches the overloaded operator
    \texttt{StAngle operator* (StAngle alpha, double c)} that returns
    type \texttt{StAngle} which of course never gets larger than
    $\pi$.

    The correct way is:
    \verb+StAngle a = 2.7;+\\
    \verb+cout << a*degree() << endl;  // works +\\
    or
    \verb+cout << static_cast<double>(a)*180/pi << endl;  // also works +\\

    Whenever you need the result of the multiplication of a
    \texttt{double} and a \texttt{StAngle} to be of type
    \texttt{double} you have to use the type cast.

\subsection{StGetConfigValue \index{StGetConfigValue|textbf}}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StGetConfigValue is a set of templated functions which read
    resource values from a given configuration file.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StGetConfigValue.hh"+


\item[Description]
    StGetConfigValue() implements a simple parser which reads resource values associated
    with a given name from a configuration file.
    There are three versions of StGetConfigValue(): one for
    reading a scalar resource, one for a multi-value
    resources (e.g arrays), and one for STL containers.

    These functions are useful when many parameters have to be read from
    one or several ascii resource files. They can not replace a real database but
    are useful for development purposes and small programs.

    StGetConfigValue() ignores every character after the shell-like comment character ``\#''
    or the C++-like comment characters ``//''. They can be used for inline comments
    as well as comments which spawn a whole line.

    \comp{\#} \args{comment}\\
    \comp{//} \args{comment}

    In the configuration file the name of the variable has to be separated from its value
    by a colon ``:''.

    \comp{name}: \comp{value}

\item[Syntax]
    \verb+template<class T>+\\
    \verb+void StGetConfigValue(const char* fname,+\\
    \verb+                      const char* name, T& val);+

    Searches the file \comp{fname} for \comp{name} and stores
    the referring value in \comp{val}. If the name is not found the value of
    \comp{val} is not altered. Note that this version can also be used to read in
    \comp{StThreeVector} objects since the \verb+operator>>()+ is properly defined in the
    context of this class.\index{StThreeVector}

    \verb+template<class T>+\\
    \verb+void StGetConfigValue(const char* fname,+\\
    \verb+                      const char* name,+\\
    \verb+                      T& val, int N);+

    Searches the file \comp{fname} for \comp{name} and stores
    the referring \comp{N} values in the {\em (i)} container object \comp{val}.
    Note that \comp{T} can be an ordinary C array (e.g. \comp{float*} or a
    STL container
    (e.g. \comp{vector}).\index{STL}
    If the name is not found the content of \comp{val} is not altered.

\subsection{StHbook \index{StHbook|textbf}} \label{StHbook}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StHbook is an HBOOK\footnote{http://wwwcn1.cern.ch/asd/index.html}
    wrapper which allows creation of 1 and 2 dimensional histograms
    and ntuples.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StHbook.hh"+\\

\item[Description]

  This class defines a wrapper that allows the user to fill and
  create one and two dimensional histograms as well as ntuples.
  It defines its own function prototypes in C, so there is no
  need for the use of \texttt{cfortran.h},\index{cfortran.h} however
  the number of operations is more limited.  Should the user require
  more functionality, such prototypes must be added.
  All initialization of HBOOK and ZEBRA is performed within the
  classes.  No additional compile flags are needed.  The user
  must ensure that his/her code be linked with \comp{packlib}.
  If the \/pawc\/ common is too small it is possible to increase
  the value of the  \texttt{constant 'SizeOfPawCommon'} to whatever
  is required and recompile.

  The initialization of HBOOK may be prevented by defining
  the macro \texttt{NO\_\-HBOOK\-\_INIT} in case it is initialized
  in other parts of the program.

\item[Persistence]
  None.

\item[Related Classes]

\subsection{StHelix \index{StHelix|textbf}} \label{StHelix}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StHelix is a parametrization of a helix which is a mathematical
    representation of the trajectory of a charged particle in a
    uniform magnetic field.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StHelix.hh"+\\
    \verb+class StHelix;+


\item[Description]

    This class defines a parameterized helix in space which can be
    used to represent the trajectory of a charged particle in a
    homogeneous magnetic field.  The parametrization is taken from
    Bock\footnote{R. K. Bock et al., {\em Data Analysis Techniques for High-Energy Physics Experiments},
      : ed M. Regler, [Cambridge University Press: 1990]. \index{Bock, R.}}.
    It is also the model that is used in
    the E896 experiment at BNL and the model used in the current
    STAR tracking code.  In the STAR coordinate system it specifies
    a helix by 5 independent parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Curvature -- the inverse of the radius of the circle in the
        x-y plane.
      \item Dip Angle -- the inclination angle of the helix in the y-z plane.
      \item Phase -- the azimuth in the xy plane measured from the ring center.
      \item Origin -- starting point of the helix.
      \item Orientation -- gives the sense of whether the helix rotates
        clockwise or counter clockwise.
    \end{itemize}
    A more detailed description of the underlying parametrization and
    several formulas used for the implementation can be found in
    appendix \ref{app:helix}.

    A special case of the helix occurs when the curvature is set to
    zero.  This represents a straight line \index{straight line}
    and so the StHelix class can be used to represent tracks in
    the absence of a magnetic field as well.  The origin of the helix
    is specified by an \comp{StThreeVector} and may be set
    individually as may all other components of the parametrization.
    The interface provides access functions for all parameters that define
    the helix. \\
    \textbf{Important:} For $B = 0$ the sense of rotation is ill defined.
    All what matters is that $\Phi_0 = \Psi - h \pi/2$ is done correctly,
    i.e.~with the same arbitrary $h$ as passed to the constructor as last
    argument.


\item[Persistence]
    None

\item[Related Classes]
    Class {\bf StPhysicalHelix} is derived from StHelix\index{StPhysicalHelix}
    which defines a helix by specifying the 3 momentum, the charge, and
    the origin of a particle.

\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    \verb+StHelix(double c, double dip, double phase,+\\
    \verb+        const StThreeVector<double>& o, int h=-1);+ \\
    Constructs a helix with curvature=c, dip angle=dip, phase=phase,
    origin=o, and charge=-h.
    Note that for $B = 0$ (\texttt{c} = 0) the sense of rotation is ill defined.
    All what matters is that $\Phi_0 = \Psi - h \pi/2$ is done correctly,
    i.e.~with the same arbitrary $h$ as passed to the constructor as last
    argument.

    \verb+StHelix(const StHelix& hlx)+\\
    Copy Constructor. Constructs a helix with the content of \comp{hlx}.

\item[Public Member\\ Operators]
    None

\item[Public Member\\ Functions]
    It is possible to set and access the data members within the class
    via the names associated with a space-time vector:

    \verb+double dipAngle() const;+\\
    Returns the dip angle of the helix.

    \verb+double curvature() const;+\\
    Returns the curvature (1/R) of the helix in the xy plane.

    \verb+double phase() const;+\\
    Returns the phase of the helix.

    \verb+double xcenter() const;+\\
    Returns the x-coordinate of the center of the circle.

    \verb+double ycenter() const;+\\
    Returns the y-coordinate of the center of the circle.

    \verb+double h() const;+\\
    Returns the orientation of the helix.  In StPhysicalHelix it
    has the meaning: -sign(q*B) where q is the charge of the particle
    and B is the sign of the magnetic field.  It specifies whether
    the helix rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise.

    \verb+StThreeVector<double>& origin() const;+\\
    Returns the origin or starting point of the helix.

    \verb+void setParameters(double c, double dip, double phase,+\\
    \verb+                   StThreeVector<double> o, int h);+ \\
    Sets parameters in a unique an order dependent way.

    \verb+double x(double s) const;+\\
    Returns the x-coordinate of the helix at a pathlength \args{s}.

    \verb+double y(double s) const;+\\
    Returns the y-coordinate of the helix at a pathlength \args{s}.

    \verb+double z(double s) const;+\\
    Returns the z-coordinate of the helix at a pathlength \args{s}.

    \verb+StThreeVector<double> at(double s) const;+\\
    Returns the position in three space of the helix at a pathlength \args{s}.

    \verb+double period() const;+\\
    Returns the period length of the helix.

    \verb+pair<double, double> pathLength(double r) const;+\\
    Returns the path length of the helix given a radial distance
    (specified in cylindrical coordinates).  A pair is returned because
    the function is double valued within a single period.  The smallest
    path length (sometimes negative) is returned as the first number of
    the pair.

    \verb+double pathLength(const StThreeVector<double>& p) const;+\\
    Given a position \args{p} in space, returns the path length of the helix
    at the distance of closest approach to the helix.

    \verb+double pathLength(double x, double y) const;+\\
    Given a position in the xy-plane, returns the path length of the
    helix at the distance of closest approach to the helix in the
    plane.  Note, that the result differs from that of the previous
    method which returns the distance of closest approach in 3
    dimensions. Only for helices with zero dip angle both methods will
    return the same values.

    \verb+double pathLength(const StThreeVector<double>& r,+\\
    \verb+                  const StThreeVector<double>& n) const;+\\
    Returns the path length at which the helix intersects with a
    given plane. The plane is defined by two vectors: \args{r} and
    \args{n}. \args{r} defines the position of one (arbitrary) point
    on the plane
    and \args{n} is the referring normal vector. This method works
    for straight tracks and helices. In case no solution exist, i.e.,
    the helix does not intersect with the plane, the largest possible
    numeric value is returned. This number can be obtained by:
     \verb+numeric_limits<double>::max()+.\\

     \verb+pair<double, double> pathLengths(const StHelix& h) const;+\\
     Returns the path lengths at the distance-of-closest-approach
     \index{dca} \index{distance of closest approach} between self and
     \args{h}, i.e., the DCA between two helices.  The first element
     of the pair is the referring path length of self and the second
     element the path length of \args{h}.  The method is fast and
     robust but execution time will increase slightly for two helices
     with very different dip angles and/or for large distances.  The
     following pseudo-code explains how to get the actual dca:

    {\footnotesize
    \begin{verbatim}
// given helix 'myhelix' and 'otherHelix'
pair<double, double>  s = myhelix.pathLengths(otherHelix);
double dca = abs(myhelix.at(s.first)-otherHelix.at(s.second));
    \end{verbatim}
    }% end footnotesize

    \verb+double distance(const StThreeVector<double>& p) const;+\\
    Returns the minimal distance between a point \args{s} and self.
    Uses \comp{pathLength()} to obtain \args{s} at the distance of closest
    approach and returns \comp{abs(at(s)-p)}.\\
    Note that this method returns the distance of closest approach in 3 dimensions,
    i.e.~not in the plane. The following pseudo-code explains how to get the distance
    in the plane:

    {\footnotesize
    \begin{verbatim}
// given helix 'myhelix' and a point p
double s = myhelix.pathLength(p.x(), p.y()); // s at dca in xy-plane
double b = abs(p - myhelix.at(s));           // myhelix.distance(p) for 3d
    \end{verbatim}
    }% end footnotesize

    \verb+bool valid() const;+\\
    checks for a valid parametrization.  Currently implies that:
    \begin{description}
      \item the dip angle cannot be $\pi$/2.
      \item h = $\pm$1 only!
      \item the curvature $\geq$0.
    \end{description}

    \verb+void moveOrigin(double s);+\\
    Moves the origin along the helix to s which becomes the
    s=0 point.  This redefines the phase in a self-consistent way.

\item[Global Operators]
    \verb+int operator== (const StHelix& v1, const StHelix& v2);+\\
    Returns 1 if the parameters of the two helices are identical.

    \verb+int operator!= (const StHelix& v1, const StHelix& v2);+\\
    Returns 1 if any of the parameters of the two helices are not
    identical.


    \verb+ostream& operator<<(ostream& os, const StHelix& h);+\\
    Prints the parameters of the helix \comp{h} to output
    stream \comp{os}.

    is more flexible in terms of precision and storage optimisation, i.e.
    in order to minimize for memory and storage volume a \comp{StLorentzVector}'s
    with type argument \comp{float} can be used but easily
    transformed into a double precision version for computation when
    higher accuracy is needed.  In addition to the CLHEP version there
    are a few member functions added which are useful in the context
    of Heavy-Ion Physics such as \comp{rapidity()}, and \comp{mt()}.
    \index{Heavy-Ion Physics}

    The template argument is used to define the type associated with
    the x (p$_{x}$), y (p$_{y}$), z (p$_{z}$), and t (E) components.
    This argument must be one of the floating
    point number data types available in the C++ language, either
    \comp{float}, \comp{double}, or \comp{long double}. The
    default type is \comp{double}.  These are also specified as:
    \comp{StFloat}, \comp{StDouble}, or \comp{StLongDouble} in
    the STAR CLASS LIBRARY.

    Please note that \comp{StLorentzVector} is {\em not} virtual. This
    is a compromise in order to minimize the storage size, i.e. to
    avoid the additional ballast of the virtual table pointer.

    StLorentzVectorD is a non-template version of \verb+StLorentzVector<double>+

\item[Description]
    The member functions, operators and non-member functions are identical
    to those in \verb+StLorentzVector<T>+ but might be slightly slower in execution speed
    since the inline mechanism cannot be used as extensive as for the template
    version. Operations can be mixed with the non-template single precision version
    \texttt{StLorentzVectorF} and with \texttt{StThreeVectorF}, \texttt{StThreeVectorD},

\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StMatrix is a templated class defining
    matrices and associated operations.

  \verb+#define MATRIX_BOUND_CHECK+ \\
  \verb+#include "StMatrix.hh"+ \\
  \verb+template<class T> StMatrix;+


\item[Description]

    This class defines matrices of arbitrary dimension as well as
    associated operations that can be performed on a
    single matrix or algebraic operations that combine matrices.
    Its interface is modelled very closely to that of
    \comp{Matrix} in CLHEP \index{CLHEP} but it is templated and
    can handle operations on matrices of different types.
    It extends on the functionality of \comp{Matrix} in CLHEP
    by allowing multiplication of a matrix with
    a \comp{vector} \index{vector} from the Standard C++ library
    as well as \comp{StThreeVector} \index{StThreeVector}
    and \comp{StLorentzVector} \index{StLorentzVector} from the
    Star Class Library (see Synopsis for required \comp{define} statements).
    The storage of the matrix elements is done
    by pointer instead of using a Standard C++ or STL container to
    reduce overhead of the class.  Unlike CLHEP, no distinction is made
    between the various matrix types such as a symmetric or diagonal
    matrix.  This increases the memory required for the storage
    of some matrices, however it greatly reduces the amount of code required.
    It also allows the class to be completely non-virtual.
    For the storage of matrices in a data base, this point may have to be
    addressed in the near future.
    The use of \comp{friends} has been greatly reduced in the mathematical
    operations and access functions according to the Star Coding Guidelines
    \index{coding Guidelines} have been included.  The class
    retains a macro definition from the CLHEP implementation to do bounds
    checking.

    The template argument is used to define the type associated with
    the elements (i.e. M$_{ij}$) of the matrix.  This argument must
    be one of the floating point number data types available in
    the C++ language, either \comp{float}, \comp{double},
    or \comp{long double}. The default type is \comp{double}.
    These are also specified as:
    \comp{StFloat}, \comp{StDouble}, or \comp{StLongDouble} in
    the STAR CLASS LIBRARY.  It should be noted that the member function
    \comp{swap()} which swaps two matrices only works with matrices of
    the same type.

\item[Related Classes]
    Class StMatrix is a base class that may be used to derive
    a {\bf StRotation}\index{StRotation} class
    and a {\bf StBoost}\index{StBoost} class in the near future.

\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    \verb+StMatrix<DataType>();+ \\
    Constructs a matrix with zero rows and zero columns.

    \verb+StMatrix<DataType>(size_t p, size_t q, size_t init=0);+ \\
    Constructs a matrix with {\em p} rows and {\em q} columns.  By
    default all the elements within the matrix are initialized
    to 0.  If {\em init=1}, and the matrix is N$\times$N, the diagonal
    elements are initialized to 1 (i.e. the identity matrix).  If
    {\em init} is specified as 1 and the matrix is not square, the
    elements are all initialized to 0.

    \verb+template<class X>+\\
    \verb+StMatrix<DataType>(const StMatrix<X>& m1)+\\
    Copy Constructor. Constructs a matrix with the contents of \comp{m1}.
    Note that \comp{m1} can be an object with different

    a matrix of type \comp{double} with an matrix of type
    \comp{float} and vice versa.

    indices outside these boundaries is platform
    dependent. If the compiler supports exception handling and
    \comp{ST\_USES\_EXCEPTIONS} is defined, an
    \comp{out\_of\_range} exception is thrown, otherwise a
    messages is printed to cerr alerting the user to an out\_of\_range
    condition.

    \verb+T operator() (size_t i, size_t j);+\\
    Assigns components by index. Note that 1$\leq$i$\leq$p where p
    is the number of rows and 1$\leq$j$\leq$q where q is

    indices outside these boundaries is platform
    dependent. If the compiler supports exception handling and
    \comp{ST\_USES\_EXCEPTIONS} is defined, an
    \comp{out\_of\_range} exception is thrown, otherwise a
    messages is printed to cerr alerting the user to an out\_of\_range
    condition.

    \verb+T operator[] (size_t c) const;+\\
    Allows C style access to elements of a matrix. \\

\item[Summary]
    Provides information on the memory allocator.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StMemoryInfo.hh"+\\
    \verb+class StMemoryInfo;+

\item[Description]
    Provides instrumentation describing space (memory) usage.
    The class is implemented as a singleton. The obtained information
    is platform dependent because of the different ways memory is
    allocated and managed by the different compilers and architectures.
    All memory information is obtained through a \comp{mallinfo()} system
    call (usually in malloc.h).

    The class is not functional on SUN (CC4.2). It will nevertheless
    compile and link but will provide no memory statistics.

\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    StMemoryInfo is a singleton and therefore has no
    public constructor. The only way to obtain an instance,
    (or better an pointer to the only instance)
    of StMemoryInfo is through the static member function
    instance().

    \verb+static StMemoryInfo* instance();+\\
    Returns pointer to the only instance of StMemoryInfo.

\item[Public Member\\ Functions]
    \verb+void snapshot();+\\
    Take a snapshot of the current memory usage.

    \verb+void print(ostream& = cout);+\\
    Prints the memory usage as recorded by the snapshot()
    member function. The output is platform dependent. In any
    case the difference to the previous snapshot is printed
    as well.

\label{StMemoryPool}
\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
  Utility class which can be used to allocate a large number of
  small objects efficiently.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StMemoryPool.hh"+\\
    \verb+class StMemoryPool(size_t);+

\item[Description]
    The idea is taken from:
    B. Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language, third edition,
    Chapter 19.4.2 (page 570).

    The class should be used if a large number of small objects
    has to be frequently allocated from heap. It is much more efficient and
    faster than the standard new/delete mechanism.
    Memory gets allocated in larger chunks and partitioned according to
    the size of the objects. The class manages the memory itself avoiding
    too frequent usage of new/delete (malloc/free).
    On order to use \texttt{StMemoryPool} the referring class
    (here called \texttt{X}) must be modified by adding the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
// in the header file X.h
class X {
public:
    void* operator new(size_t) { return mPool.alloc(); }
    void  operator delete(void* p)  { mPool.free(p); }
    // ...
private:
    static StMemoryPool mPool;
    ...
}

// in the source file X.cc (X.cxx)
StMemoryPool X::mPool(sizeof(X));
\end{verbatim}

Note, that the size of the class X does not increase
sonce the pool is contained as a static member.

Only single objects may be created,
i.e, new X[100] will not work; however, in these cases the
default operators new/delete will be called.


\item[Public\\ Constructors]
    \verb+StMemoryPool(unsigned int n);+\\
    Creates a memory pool for objects of
    size \texttt{n}. The best way is to
    call the constructor as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    StMemoryPool mPool(sizeof(X));
\end{verbatim}

\item[Public Member\\ Functions]
    \verb+void* alloc();+\\
    Returns memory to hold one element.

    \verb+void  free(void*);+\\
    Put the memory of one element back in the pool.

\begin{Entry}
\item[Summary]
    StPhysicalHelix describes the trajectory of a charged particle in a
    uniform magnetic field. While its base class StHelix
    represents only the mathematical model StPhysicalHelix provides
    additional access to physical quantities associated with a particles
    trajectory, e.g. charge and momentum.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StPhysicalHelix.hh"+\\
    \verb+class StPhysicalHelix;+

\item[Description]

    Other than StHelix instances of StPhysicalHelix can be created
    from known physical quantities as charge and momentum
    of a trajectory in a magnetic
    field. The same values can also be returned from
    StPhysicalHelix even if the object was instantiated with mathematical
    parameters (curvature, dip angle, phase, origin and orientation).

    No equivalent class exists in CLHEP.

    In the following only those methods are described which are specific
    to StPhysicalHelix are described in the following. For a full description of
    StHelix see section \ref{StHelix}.

\item[Summary]
    StPrompt is a templated function to prompt the user for input of
    various type.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StPrompt.hh"+


\item[Description]
  Template function to prompt the user for input of type T.
  Reads the new input value, except if \verb+<CR>+ is
  pressed directly after the prompt. In this case the
  previous value (indicated in brackets) stays untouched.

  This function is essentially useful for debugging purposes and in small
  programs (prototyping) where user input is required.

\item[Syntax]
    \verb+void StPrompt(const char* txt,T& var);+\\
    Prompt for a value of type \comp{T}. The prompt string includes
    the given text \comp{txt} and the current value of \comp{var}
    in square brackets (default value). The new input value is assigned
    to \comp{var} except if \verb+<CR>+ is pressed directly after the prompt
    string in which case the content of \comp{var} is not altered.
    For non-build-in data types make sure the input and output
    operators \verb+<<+ and \verb+>>+ are defined. (Note, that
    both operators are defined for StThreeVector!)\index{StThreeVector}

    In addition to the more general version a few specializations
    are provided:

    \verb+void StPrompt(const char* txt, bool& var);+\\
    In this case the functions accepts \textit{true, t, yes, y, on, 1}
    as \comp{true}. Everything else yields \comp{false}
    (except \verb+<CR>+).\\
    {\bf Note:} On Sun platforms the native CC compiler does not provide \comp{bool}
    as fundamental type and is therefore implemented as type \comp{int}.
    As a consequence \\
    \verb+void StPrompt(const char* txt, bool& var);+\\
    cannot be distinguished from \\
    \verb+void StPrompt(const char* txt, int& var);+.\\
    On Sun platforms (\comp{STAR\_SYS=sun4x*}) this specializations is
    disabled and replaced by:
    \verb+void StBoolPrompt(const char* txt, bool& var);+\\

    \verb+void StPrompt(const char *txt, char* var, int len);+\\
    Prompts for a C-like character string. In this case the length
    of the array has to be passed in order to prevent memory violations
    \footnote{The STL \comp{string} class should always be preferred
        over C-like character strings.}.

    \verb+void StPrompt();+\\
    Prints "-- Press return to continue -- " on the screen and waits

\index{random numbers}
\begin{Entry}

\item[Summary]

    \texttt{StRandom} is an interface to the various random generators
    provided by CLHEP (see \ref{Random}).  It eases their use and
    avoids common problems. It is not intended not provide the full
    functionality of all the related CLHEP classes but the most common
    ones.

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StRandom.hh"+\\
    \verb+class StRandom;+

\item[Description]

    CLHEP provides a rich set of random generators and random engines
    which can be mixed freely (see \ref{Random}). However, their use
    is sometimes cumbersome and error-prone. The aim of
    \texttt{StRandom} is to provide an interface\footnote{In terms of
        ``Design Patterns'' \texttt{StRandom} is a ``Facade''.} which
    is simple to use and appropriate for most standard applications.
    No new algorithm is added; all methods are simple access
    functions. Only the most commonly used methods are interfaced. For
    example the generation of arrays of random numbers is omitted. If
    you need these features you have to use the original classes
    directly.

    \texttt{StRandom} allows to generate all kinds of distributions
    (flat, Gaussian, Poissonian, exponential, and Breit-Wigner)
    without switching classes as one has to do with in CLHEP.

    All internal engines and generators used in \texttt{StRandom} are
    kept as static data members and so are all methods. This allows
    their use without explicitly creating an instance of
    \texttt{StRandom}.  For example, to generate a flat and a Gaussian
    random number you can either use:
\begin{verbatim}
    StRandom rndm;
    cout << rndm.flat() << endl;
    cout << rndm.gauss(1, 0.3) << endl;
\end{verbatim}
    or without creating an instance explicitly:
\begin{verbatim}
    cout << StRandom::flat() << endl;
    cout << StRandom::gauss(1.7,0.3) << endl;
\end{verbatim}

    \texttt{StRandom} uses internally the most advanced random engine
    available, the RanluxEngine.

    Note, that you are able to use StRandom everywhere in your code
    withour having to worry about getting the same series of random
    numbers.  This happens if you create an instances of the CLHEP
    'engines' locally, e.g.~in a function which you invoke several
    times. The proper way to deal with CLHEP random generators is to
    have the engine in global scope and then create instances of the
    generators with the global engine as arguments.

\item[Persistence]
    None

\item[Related Classes]
        \texttt{StRandom} uses internally the following classes:
    \texttt{RanluxEngine}, \texttt{RandFlat},

    SUN with the CC4 compiler. Note, that one also has to set the \comp{ST\_SOLVE\_TEMPLATES}
    flag in order to enable the template instatiation. This allows the use of \comp{StTemplates.hh}
    also on non-cfront compilers. By setting or omitting this macro in the referring Makefile
    one can selectively switch the forced instantiation on and off.

\item[Summary]
    StThreeVector is a templated general 3-vector class defining
    vectors in three dimension (see Fig.~\ref{fig:StThreeVector}).

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StThreeVector.hh"+ \\
    \verb+template<class T> StThreeVector;+


\item[Description]

    This class defines a general 3-vector which can be used to
    represent space points and 3-momenta.  It has a large set of
    member functions, member operators and associated global operators
    which allow to multiply, subtract and add vectors with other
    vectors or scalar variables, calculate cross products and angles
    between vectors, and much more. Once defined its coordinates can
    be obtained in Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical
    representation.  Its interface is essentially the same as
    \comp{ThreeVector} in CLHEP \index{CLHEP} with two significant differences:
    (i) it is templated vector and (ii) it is a concrete class, i.e.
    it is not derived from any other class.  It offers essentially the
    same functionality as the CLHEP version but is more flexible in
    terms of precision and storage optimisation; i.e. in order to
    minimize for memory and storage volume a \comp{StThreeVector}'s
    with type argument \comp{float} can be used but easily
    transformed into a double precision version for computation when
    higher accuracy is needed.  In addition to the CLHEP version there
    are a few member functions added which are useful in the context
    of Heavy-Ion Physics such as \comp{pseudoRapidity()}.

    The template argument is used to define the type associated with
    the x, y, z components. This argument must be one of the floating
    point number data types available in the C++ language, either
    \comp{float}, \comp{double}, or \comp{long double}. The
    default type is \comp{double}.

    Please note that \comp{StThreeVector} is {\em not} virtual. This
    is a compromise in order to minimize the storage size, i.e. to
    avoid the additional ballast of the virtual table pointer.

    CPU timer

\item[Synopsis]
    \verb+#include "StTimer.hh"+ \\
    \verb+StTimer timer;+

\item[Description]
    This class can measure elapsed CPU (user) time. The timer has two
    states: running and stopped. The timer measures the total amount
    of time spent in the "running" state since it was either
    constructed or reset.

    The timer is put into the "running" state by calling member
    function \comp{start()}. It is put into the "stopped" state by
    calling \comp{stop()}.

    StTimer uses the system-dpendent function \comp{clock()} which
    returns the number of "ticks" since it was first called. As a
    result, StTimer will not be able to measure intervals longer than
    some system-dependent value. (For instance, on several common UNIX
    systems, this value is just under 36 minutes.)

    The resolution of the timer is given by the number of "ticks" per
    second.  This value is system dependent and can be checked with
    the \comp{resolution()} member function. Make sure that the CPU time
    between the start and stop of the timer is significantly larger
    than the resolution.

    N.B. The interface of this class and its functionality were adapted
    from the tools.h++ class library from RogueWave.

\item[Description]

  Random consists of a series of classes that provide mechanisms to
  generate pseudo-random numbers according to one of five pre-determined
  distributions:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Flat
   \item Poissonian
   \item Exponential
   \item Gaussian
   \item Breit-Wigner
  \end{itemize}

  In order to generate a random number according to these distributions
  a pseudo-random number engine must be provided.  These engines
  utilize either a predefined (static) seed table \index{seed table}
  or a seed given by the user and one of several prescriptions
  to generate a pseudo-random
  number in a flat distribution.  These numbers are then used to generate
  a random number based on a characteristic distribution.

  It should be noted that these classes are nearly exact copies of those
  used in CLHEP\index{CLHEP} (hence the lack of the ``{\bf St}'' prefix)
  adapted for use in the STAR Class Library.  Member functions that

     {\em The Specific Engines:}

     \begin{description}
       \item {\bf HepJamesRandom} implements the algorithm of
       Marsaglia-Zaman RANMAR which is described in
       {\em F.  James, Comp. Phys. Comm. {\bf 60} (1990) 329}.  It is a
       component of the MATHLIB HEP library for pseudo-random
       number generation.  This is the default random engine invoked
       by each distribution unless the user specifies a different one.

       \item {\bf DRand48Engine} uses \comp{drand48()}
         and \comp{srand48()} functions from the C standard library
         to implement the basic \comp{flat()} basic distribution and
         for setting seeds.  Note that this file is part of the
         Geant4 \index{GEANT4} simulation toolkit.

       \item {\bf RandEngine} uses the \comp{rand()} and \comp{srand()}
         functions from the C standard library to implement the \comp{flat()}
         basic distribution and for setting seeds.  Note that this file is
         part of Geant4 simulation toolkit.

       \item {\bf RanecuEngine} is an algorithm that is part of the
         MATHLIB HEP library.  Seeds are taken from a seed table
         and given an index.  The \comp{getSeed()} member function
         returns the current index of the seed table, while the
         \comp{getSeeds()} member function returns a pointer to the
         local table of seeds at the current index.  Note that this file
         is part of Geant4 simulation toolkit.

       \item {\bf RanluxEngine} is an algorithm originally implemented
         in FORTRAN by Fred James as part of the MATHLIB HEP
         library.  The initialisation is carried out using a
         Multiplicative Congruential generator using formula constants
         of L'Ecuyer as described in {\em F. James, Comp. Phys. Comm. 60 (1990) 329}.
         Note that this file is part of Geant4 simulation toolkit.

  {\bf The Distributions:}

     Class {\em HepRandom} contained in \comp{Random.h} is a base class
     from which all distribution
     classes inherit.  An object of this class is instantiated by
     default within the HEP Random module.  An instantiated {\em HepJamesRandom}
     engine is used as a default algorithm for pseudo-random number
     generation.  HepRandom defines a static private data member
     \comp{theGenerator} and a set of static inlined methods to
     manipulate it. By means of \comp{theGenerator} the user can:
     \begin{itemize}
        \item change the underlying engine algorithm.
        \item get and set the seeds.
        \item use any kind of defined random distribution.
      \end{itemize}
      {\bf Note:} Distribution classes inherit from {\em HepRandom} and define
      {\bf both} static and non-static interfaces.

\appendix
\section{Helix Parametrization}
\label{app:helix} \index{helix parameters}
The trajectory of a charged particle in a static uniform magnetic
field with $\vec{B} = (0, 0, B_z)$ is a helix. In principle five
\footnote{see \ref{sec:hparam} for a detailed discussion on the number of parameters needed.}
parameters are needed to define such a helix. From the various
possible parametrizations we describe here the version which is well
suited for the geometry of a collider experiment and therefore used
for the implementation of the \name{StHelix} class. \index{StHelix}

This parametrization describes the helix in Cartesian coordinates,
where $x, y$ and $z$ are expressed as functions of the track length
$s$.

\begin{eqnarray}
    x(s) & = & x_0 + \frac{1}{\kappa} [\cos(\Phi_0 + h\ s\ \kappa\ \cos\lambda) - \cos\Phi_0] \label{eq:xs} \\
    y(s) & = & y_0 + \frac{1}{\kappa} [\sin(\Phi_0 + h\ s\ \kappa\ \cos\lambda) - \sin\Phi_0] \label{eq:ys} \\
    z(s) & = & z_0 + s\ \sin\lambda \label{eq:zs}
\end{eqnarray}
where here and in the following:
\begin{description}
\item[$s$] is the path length along the helix\index{path length}
\item[$x_0, y_0, z_0$] is the starting point at $s = s_0 = 0$
\item[$\lambda$] is the dip angle\index{dip angle}
\item[$\kappa$] is the curvature, i.e.~$\kappa = 1/R$\index{curvature}
\item[$B$] is the z component of the homogeneous magnetic field ($B = (0, 0, B_z)$)
\item[$q$] is charge of the particle in units of positron charge
\item[$h$] is the sense of rotation of the projected helix in the $xy$-plane,\\
           i.e.~ $h = -\mathrm{sign}(q B) = \pm 1$
\item[$\Phi_0$] is the azimuth angle of the starting point (in
                cylindrical coordinates) with respect to the helix axis ($\Phi_0 =
                \Psi - h \pi/2$)\index{phase}
\item[$\Psi$] is the $\arctan(\mathrm{d}y/\mathrm{d}x)_{s = 0}$,
              i.e.~the azimuthal angle of the track direction at the starting point.
\end{description}
The meaning of the different parameters is visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:helix}.

  \subfigure[Projection of a helix on the $sz$ plane.]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{helix2.eps}}}
  \caption{Helix parametrization}
  \label{fig:helix}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Calculation of the particle momentum}

The circle fit in the $xy$-plane gives the center of the fitted circle $(x_c, y_c)$
and the curvature $\kappa = 1/R$ while the linear fit gives $z_0$ and $\tan \lambda$.
The phase of the helix (see Fig.~\ref{fig:helix}) is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Phi_0 = \arctan \left( \frac{y_0 - y_c}{x_0 - x_c} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
The reference point $(x_0, y_0)$ is then calculated as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_0 & = & x_c + \frac{\cos \Phi_0}{\kappa} \\
  y_0 & = & y_c + \frac{\sin \Phi_0}{\kappa}
\end{eqnarray}
and the helix parameters can be evaluated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Psi & = & \Phi_0 + h \pi / 2 \\
  p_\perp & = & c\ q\ B / \kappa \\
  p_z & = & p_\perp \tan \lambda \\
  p & = & \sqrt{p^2_\perp + p^2_z}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\kappa$ is the curvature in [m$^{-1}$], $B$ the value of the
magnetic field in [Tesla], $c$ the speed of light in [m/ns] ($\approx
0.3$) and $p_\perp$ and $p_z$ are the transverse and longitudinal
momentum in [GeV/c].

\subsection{Distant measure}
\index{distance of closest approach}
\index{dca}
The minimal squared distance $M_i$ between a helix and a
point $i$ with position $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
     M_i & = & M_i^{(xy)} + M_i^{(z)} \\
     M_i & = & (x_i - x(s^\prime))^2 + (y_i - y(s^\prime))^2 + (z_i - z(s^\prime))^2 \\
\end{eqnarray}
In literature one finds the following approach to solve this problem analytically
by neglecting $M_i^{(z)}$ in the derivatives.
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}M_i^{xy}}{\mathrm{d}s}  = 0
\end{eqnarray}
This formula can only serve to derive an approximation for the real distance.
For large dip angles the errors become large depending also on the actual helix
parameters. The advantage is that $s^\prime$ can be calculated analytically:
\begin{eqnarray}
  s^\prime = \frac{1}{h \kappa \cos\lambda} \arctan \left(
    \frac{(y_i-y_0)\cos\Phi_0 - (x_i-x_0) \sin\Phi_0}
    {1/\kappa + (x_i-x_0) \cos\Phi_0 + (y_i-y_0)\sin\Phi_0} \right) \label{eq:dist}
\end{eqnarray}
Note, that this formula can {\bf not} be used to derive the distance of closest
approach to a point.
In order to derive the distance of closest approach the following equation
has to be solved:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}M_i}{\mathrm{d}s}  = 0
\end{eqnarray}
which can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
&&2\,\left (x_i-x_0-{\frac {\cos(\Phi_0+h s
  \kappa\cos\lambda)-\cos\Phi_0}{\kappa}}\right)
  \sin(\Phi_0+h s \kappa\cos\lambda)\ h\cos\lambda -  \nonumber \\
&&2\,\left (y_i-y_0-{\frac {\sin(\Phi_0+h s \kappa\cos\lambda)-\sin
  \Phi_0}{\kappa}}\right)
  \cos(\Phi_0+ h s \kappa\cos\lambda)\ h\cos\lambda- \nonumber \\
&&2\,\left(z_i-z_0-s\sin\lambda\right )\sin\lambda = 0   \label{eq:dsolve}
\end{eqnarray}
The root of eq.~\ref{eq:dsolve} can easily be found with the Newton or
{\it regula falsi} method
with $s^\prime$ from eq.~\ref{eq:dist} as starting value.
For the Newton method the second derivative is needed as well.
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2M_i}{\mathrm{d}s^2}  = 0
\end{eqnarray}
which is
\begin{eqnarray}
    &2&\left (\sin(\Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda)\right )^{2}{h}^{2}\cos^{2}\lambda + \nonumber \\
    &2&\left (x_i-{x_0}-{\frac {\cos(\Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda)-\cos\Phi_0}{\kappa}}\right ) \nonumber \\
    & &\cos(\Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda){h}^{2}\kappa \cos^{2}\lambda + \nonumber \\
    &2&\left (\cos(\Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda)\right )^{2}{h}^{2}\cos^{2}\lambda +  \nonumber \\
    &2&\left (y_i-{y_0}-{\frac {\sin(
                \Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda)-\sin\Phi_0}{\kappa}}\right ) \nonumber \\
    & &\sin(\Phi_0+hs\kappa\cos\lambda){h}^{2}\kappa
    \cos^{2}\lambda + \nonumber \\
    &2&\sin^2\lambda = 0
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Distance of closest approach between two helices}
\index{dca between helices} The closest distance between two helices
$H_1$ and $H_2$ is a problem which again can be solved analytically
only in 2 dimensions, i.e., in the xy-plane.  The solution in 3
dimensions cannot even be solved by standard numerical methods (as the
Newton method) but requires more sophisticated method since we have to
find 2 unknown parameters $s_1$ and $s_2$ in
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 M(s_1, s_2)}{\mathrm{d} s_1 \mathrm{d} s_2} = 0
\end{eqnarray}
where $M$ is the distance between the two helices at $s_1$ and $s_2$.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{twoHelices.eps}
        \caption{Two intersecting helices in the xy-plane}
    \end{center}
    \label{fig:dcahelices}
\end{figure}
{\bf In the xy-plane:}\\
Given two helices with radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ and centers in the
xy-plane $o_1 = (x_{c1}, y_{c1})$ and $o_2 = (x_{c2}, y_{c2})$ we have
to find vector $\vec{a}$ as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:dcahelices}.  The
angle $\alpha$ can be calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \cos \alpha = \frac{R^2_1 + |\vec{r}|^2 - R^2_2}{2 R_1 |\vec{r}|}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{r}$ is the vector between the two centers. The absolute
coordinates of one intersection point (measured from $o_1$) can be
obtained by calculating vector $\vec{a}$ and adding $o_1$.
\begin{eqnarray}
    x_i &=& x_{c1} + R_1 [ (x_{c2}-x_{c1}) \cos \alpha -  (y_{c2}-y_{c1}) \sin \alpha]/|\vec{r}|;\\
    y_i &=& y_{c1} + R_1 [ (x_{c2}-x_{c1}) \sin \alpha +  (y_{c2}-y_{c1}) \cos \alpha]/|\vec{r}|;
\end{eqnarray}
If $\cos \alpha$ is exactly 1 we have only one solution. For the case
$\cos \alpha < 1$ we get two valid intersection points $(x_i, y_i)$
and $(x_j, y_j)$ where the latter is simply given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
    x_j &=& x_{c1} + R_1 [ (x_{c2}-x_{c1}) \cos \alpha +  (y_{c2}-y_{c1}) \sin \alpha]/|\vec{r}|;\\
    y_j &=& y_{c1} + R_1 [ (y_{c2}-y_{c1}) \cos \alpha -  (x_{c2}-x_{c1}) \sin \alpha]/|\vec{r}|;
\end{eqnarray}
In the case $\cos \alpha > 1$ the circles do not intersect. Then the
distance of closest approach is simply given by the intersection of a
line between the two centers and the two helices. For helix $H_1$ we
get:
\begin{eqnarray}
    x &=& x_{c1} + R_1 (x_{c2}-x_{c1})/|\vec{r}|;\\
    y &=& y_{c1} + R_1 (y_{c2}-y_{c1})/|\vec{r}|;
\end{eqnarray}


{\bf In 3 dimensions:}\\
Usually an iteration method is applied which uses the intersection
points in the xy-plane as start values. Care has to be taken if both
helices have different dip angle $\lambda$ since the start values then
significantly deviate from the actual solution.

\subsection{Intersection with a cylinder ($\rho$=const)}

In order to obtain the path length $s$ at which the helix
intersects with a cylinder of given radius $\rho$ we have to solve
the following equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \rho^2 = x(s)^2 + y(s)^2
\end{eqnarray}
Using eq.~\ref{eq:xs} and \ref{eq:ys} we obtain the two analytic solutions for $s_1$ and $s_2$:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:rsolve}
    s_{1/2} &=& -\left({\Phi_0}+2\,\arctan \left[
            \left(2\,{y_0}\,\kappa-2\,\sin{\Phi_0} \pm \left[ -
                    \kappa^2\left (-4\,\rho^2+4\,{y_0}^2 - 2\,\rho^2\kappa^2 x_0^2 -

                            {y_0}}^{2}+{\rho}^{4}{\kappa}^{2}+{{x_0}}^{4}{\kappa}^{2}+{{y_0}}^{4}{
                            \kappa}^{2}-4\,{{x_0}}^{3}\kappa\,\cos{\Phi_0} +
                    \right. \right. \right. \right. \right. \\ \nonumber
    & & \left. \left. \left. \left. \left.
                        4\,{{x_0}}^{2}\cos^2{\Phi_0} - 4\,{{y_0}}^{2} \cos^{2}{\Phi_0} -
                    \right. \right. \right. \right. \right. \\ \nonumber
    & & \left. \left. \left. \left. \left.

        \right] \right){h}^{-1}{\kappa}^{-1}\left (
        \cos\lambda\right )^{-1}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Intersection with a plane}

\begin{figure}[thb]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{helix3.eps}
        \caption{Intersection of a helix with a plane}
        \label{fig:plane}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Any plane can be described by its normal vector $\vec{n}$
(orientation) and an arbitrary point in this plane $\vec{r}$ (position). The vector
$\vec{p}$ which describes the intersection point must fulfil:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \vec{p} \cdot \vec{n} = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
Hence:
\begin{eqnarray}
    (\vec{a}-\vec{r}) \cdot \vec{n} = 0. \label{eq:ansatz}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{a}$ is given by $\vec{a} = (x(s^{\prime}),
y(s^{\prime}), z(s^{\prime}))$ as described in
eq.~\ref{eq:xs}--\ref{eq:zs}.  In order to obtain the path length
$s^{\prime}$ where the helix intersects with the plane the
following equation has to be solved:
\begin{eqnarray}
    x(s) n_x + y(s) n_y + z(s) n_z - \vec{r} \cdot \vec{n} &=& \\
    A + n_x \cos S
    + n_y \sin S
    + \kappa n_z s \sin \lambda &=& 0 \label{eq:inter}
\end{eqnarray}
where:
\begin{eqnarray}
    A &=& \kappa (\vec{o} \cdot \vec{n} - \vec{r} \cdot \vec{n}) - n_x \cos \Phi_0 - n_y \sin \Phi_0 \\
    S &=& h s \kappa \cos \lambda + \Phi_0
\end{eqnarray}

The root of eq.~\ref{eq:inter} can now easily be determined by a
suitable numerical method (Newton).

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:Limitations}
The only non-numerical limitations of this parametrization are:
\begin{eqnarray}
    -\pi/2 < \lambda  & < & \pi/2 \\
    \kappa & > & 0
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Case $\mathbf{B = 0}$}

For the special case $B = 0$ the trajectory becomes a straight line,
i.e. $\kappa = 0$ and $R = \infty$.  Care must be taken in the numerical
calculation of the parametrization because of the singularity in
eq.~\ref{eq:xs} and \ref{eq:ys}. The correct form is:
\begin{eqnarray}
    x(s) & = & x_0 - s h \cos\lambda \sin\Phi_0 \\
    y(s) & = & y_0 + s h \cos\lambda \cos\Phi_0 \\
    z(s) & = & z_0 + s\ \sin\lambda
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Important:} For $B = 0$ the sense of rotation is ill defined. All what matters
is that $\Phi_0 = \Psi - h \pi/2$ is done correctly, i.e.~with the same arbitrary $h$.
In the following we assume $h = +1$ for convenience.

Eq.~\ref{eq:dist} then reads as:
\begin{eqnarray}
  s^\prime = \frac{1}{\cos\lambda} \left[(y_i-y_0)\cos\Phi_0 - (x_i-x_0) \sin\Phi_0 \right]
\end{eqnarray}
Eq.~\ref{eq:dsolve} can now be solved analytically;
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\mathrm{d}M_i^{dca}}{\mathrm{d}s} = 0
\end{eqnarray}
gives:
\begin{eqnarray}
s^{dca}   & = & \cos\lambda \cos\Phi_0 (y_i-y_0) - \nonumber \\
          &   & \cos\lambda \sin\Phi_0 (x_i-x_0) + \nonumber \\
          &   & \sin\lambda (z_i-z_0)
\end{eqnarray}

The solution for the intersection with a cylinder (eq.~\ref{eq:rsolve}) now reads:
\begin{eqnarray}
s_{1/2}   & = & \left[x_0\,\cos\lambda\,\sin\Phi_0\,- y_0\,\cos\lambda\,\cos\Phi_0 \, \pm  \right. \\
   & & \left.
\left[-\cos^2\lambda\,\left(2\,x_0\,\cos\Phi_0\, y_0
\,\sin\Phi_0\,-\rho^2\, + \right. \right. \right.  \\
& & \left. \left.  \left.
y_0^2-y_0^2 \,\cos^2\Phi_0\,
+ x_0^2  \cos^2\Phi_0 \right )\right]^{1/2} \right]\, \cos^2\lambda
\end{eqnarray}


The same holds for the intersection of a helix with a plane where in case
of zero curvature eq.~\ref{eq:inter} can be solved analytically.
\begin{eqnarray}
s^{\prime} = \frac{ \vec{r} \cdot \vec{n} - \vec{o} \cdot \vec{n} }
                  {- n_x \cos \lambda \sin \Phi_0
                   + n_y \cos \lambda \cos \Phi_0
                   + n_z \sin \lambda}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Why are there only 5 independent helix parameters?}
\label{sec:hparam}

    Imagine an arbitrary helix sitting in 3D space.  What is required
    to completely specify it ?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the line coinciding with the axis - if its oriented in any arbitrary
        direction, then this requires 4 parameters, or 2 direction angles
        (theta and phi in usual spherical coordinates) plus 2 more coordinates
        to locate the line in a plane perpendicular to this direction.

        For the special case in STAR we always fix the direction
        parallel to the z-axis so this reduces the number of this subset
        of parameters from 4 to 2.

        So these are the (x,y) coordinates of the center of the circular
        projection onto the x-y plane.

    \item Then we must give the radius of the circular projection - 1 more param,

    \item Next we must specify the pitch and the handedness. - 2 more params.

    \item  Finally, we have to give a phase angle or some single number that
        tells us where this thing is actually sitting w.r.t. some given
        plane.  For STAR this could be the phase angle at the point where
        the helix intersects the x-y plane. - 1 more parameter.

    \end{enumerate}

    So, in general there are 7 continuously varying parameters plus a
    handedness switch.  For the special case STAR uses there are then
    5 independent parameters plus the left handed/right handed
    switch. So yes, 6 parameters are required.  But for track fitting
    purposes only 5 are relevant.  The handedness of the particle's
    trajectory will be determined by the
    sign of B$_z \times $ charge (using the actual charge) and the sign of the
    z-component of momentum (using the actual p$_z$ momentum value).
    However, in general the charge sign and p$_z$ direction are not
    known, based on track fitting alone.  These signs must be assumed
    using some selection criteria, usually that the particle is moving
    ``outward and away'' from the general area of the beam.  These two signs
    are not independent of each other but must be chosen to give a path
    consistent with the handedness that the space point positions require.
    So there is one algebraic sign that is ambiguous and that we have to
    choose.  Having done this there remain 5 independent fitting parameters.
    In our track parametrization we put the choice of algebraic sign
    into the both that of the charge and the tanl parameter, consistently
    we hope.

    So to summarize, there are 6 parameters, one is a sign selected by some
    criteria, the remaining 5 are varied to fit the space points.
    The track parameter error matrix is then $5 \times 5$ symmetric, and thus
    includes 15 distinct quantities.

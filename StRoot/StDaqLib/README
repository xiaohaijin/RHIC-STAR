 *
 *   change log
 * 02-Jul-99 MJL reorganized files. DetectorReader.cxx now in GENERIC,
 *               supplied various detector directories including e.g., TRG_Reader.hh
 *               so that all implementations which are detector-specific do not require
 *               editing the GENERIC directory. Detector code supplied to navigate to 
 *               detector pointer bank
 *
 ***************************************************************************
 * $Log: README,v $
 * Revision 2.0  1999/07/10 21:05:22  levine
 * Classes reorganized so that TPC, SVT, SSD, FTPC classes are derived from a
 * single set of interfaces; remianing detectors each have their own interface
 * (defined by the detector group).
 *
 * The following applies to EMC, RICH, TRG:
 * The xxx_Reader constructor is passed a pointer to its top-level pointer
 * bank (xxxP). All code which existed inside the detector-specific classes
 * which served to locate this top-level pointer bank has now been extracted and
 * moved to the EventReader::findBank() method.
 *
 * Existing user code for the TPC, SVT, FTPC, SSD should not be changed by this
 * re-organization. Other detectors now have a new API. The API for each of
 * these "other" detectors is now completely free of constraints, with the
 * exception of the arguments passed to the constructor xxx_Reader::xxx_Reader()
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1999/07/03 03:39:16  levine
 * reorganization of files described

StDaqLib:
=========

Design by Jeff Landgraf
Implementation by Jeff Landgraf and Mike LeVine with contributions by
Markus Schulz


Organization:
=============
There are several directories -

Top-level:
=========
README (this file)


examples:
========= 
client.cxx - needed for self-standing executable. Not necessary for Root
applications. In any case, use client.cxx as a tutorial of how to use
the under-lying class libraries.

Makefile - Use to build a self-standing executable. Not for use with
Root.


GENERIC (common to all detectors):
=================================
EventReader. Returns pointer to the upper-level pointer bank,
obtains information on the event (length, event number, time of creation,
trigger bits, detectors present). 

EventReader.hh - contains declarations common to all detectors 

DetectorReader.cxx - factory for making the appropriate
detector-specific readers, both specific to the detector and to the
format version. #includes [det]_Reader.hh which contains function prototypes
for all concrete methods required by the virtual DetectorReader class.

swaps. methods for byte-swapping

CRC - calculates CRC

TPC (code for the TPC only)
==========================
trans_table.hh - needed to invert the 8-bit compression done in the
DAQ front end. [See client.cxx for example of how to use.]

TPCV1(2)P0.hh - declarations of class members for TPC readers

TPCV1(2)P0.Banks.cxx, TPCV1(2)P0.Banks.hh - declarations of
TPC-specific DAQ data banks, and methods to print them plus overrides
on default swap behavior

TPCV1(2)P0_ADCR_SR.cxx - sector reader for TPC data in TPCADCR/TPCPADK
banks. Populates padlist, sets pointers to pad ADC data.

TPCV1(2)P0_CPPR_SR.cxx - sector reader for TPC data in TPCCPPR/TPCPADK
banks. Gets pointers to arrays of Sequence cluster structs for each pad.

TPCV1(2)P0_Reader.hh - TPC detector reader virtual class

TPCV1(2)P0_ZS_SR.cxx - sector reader for zero-suppressed TPC data in
TPCADCD, TPCSEQD banks. If any of these banks are missing for a given
mezzanine board, the ZS sector reader will attempt to construct them
from the TPCADCR, TPCPADK banks if they exist. End result is a
fully-populated set of sector Sequence structs. Also provides access
to the data based on FEE/pin coordinates

fee_pin.h - used by the FEE/pin access method above

TPCStructs.hh - contains TPC struct definitions desirable to be available to
the client code (top level), such as ASIC_params, ASIC_cluster, Sequence.



OTHERS:
======
other detector groups are expected to emulate the TPC
directory to describe their detectors in an appropriate manner. Please
note that the methodology to locate the upper-most detector-specific
pointer bank has changed. Please copy the method used in 
TPCV2P0_Reader::TPCV2P0_Reader.

[det]_Reader.hh supplied to satisfy linker. No methods are supplied except
the constructor, which contains code to navigate to the detector-specific
pointer bank (e.g., SVTP). This code should probably be moved to a .cxx file
by the relevant group, and overrides should be supplied where appropriate
(especially swap()).

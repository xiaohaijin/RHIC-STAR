This directory is a placeholder for all FilterMakers.

Each FilterMaker must use either default parameters or parameters
from DB. Selection of them is based on DateTime provided by bfc.

Ex: If you wish to change static parameters of a given filter
    to create a new one, consider using a DB approach instead
    of replicating codes.


Unresolved:
  - It is not clear now how to do it in the case of several filters, 
    where different filters would be needed at different place in
    the chain but we would see such a case at a later time when the
    issue will arise. 
  - Combination such as XOR would not be supported at this time
    and if needed, special logic would need to be implemented.

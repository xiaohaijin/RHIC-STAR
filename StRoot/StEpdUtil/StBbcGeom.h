 * \description:
 *  class defining geometrical aspects of the inner BBC
 *  (position of tile center, tile corners, etc.)
 *
 * The BBC is a holy nightmare because one PMT connects
 *  to *either* one or two disjoint tiles.  Also, the
 *  PMT number is the same as the tile number sometimes,
 *  but not all the time.  Plus the numbering starts
 *  at zero sometimes and not other times.
 *
 * In this class, we are only talking about tiles
 *  and tile geometry.  Another class will give you the
 *  map from PMT number to tile(s).
 *
 *
 * Because some users will use the sign of the tileId
 *  to denote east/west, and some will use an explicit
 *  integer, we provide overloaded functions, to allow both.

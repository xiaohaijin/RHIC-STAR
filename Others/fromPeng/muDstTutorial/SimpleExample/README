SimpleExample Notes: 

Make sure to "cons" in this directory before you try to run
the macro.  This is because it depends on software in the
StRoot subdirectory.

The "toURL" defines where you output will go.  It must be an
absolute pathname.  It cannot be a wildcard or have a relative
location.

You must change the "toURL" in the SimpleAnalysis.xml file so that 
it contains the absolute path to an existing directory where you 
have read/write priveleges (e.g. the current directory will do for 
a small number of *.root files).  So for example,
toURL="file:/star/institutions/myInstitution/myName/myTestArea"

Execute with: 
   star-submit SimpleAnalysis.xml  

Histogram output will go into files named (for example)
"JobID.histograms.root"

Browse with root4star 
   root4star[0]  new TBrowser("JobID.histograms.root")
   and then click on RootFiles and then each histogram

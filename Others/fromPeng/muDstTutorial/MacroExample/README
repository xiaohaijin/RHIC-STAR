MacroExample.C() Notes:

Make sure to "cons" in this directory before you try to run
the macro.  This is because it depends on software in the
StRoot subdirectory.

Execute the MacroExample.C() macro using root4star.  You 
must also tell it how many files to read and the name of 
the directory where the files live, or alternatively the 
name of the file to read.  A sample *.MuDst.root file for
tesing is located in /star/institutions/lbl/jhthomas/muDstTutorial/

The output (histograms) will appear on the screen.

For example:

root4star [0] .x MacroExample.C(1,"filename.MuDst.root")
